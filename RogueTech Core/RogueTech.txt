=========
CHANGELOG!
=========
KNOWN ISSUES - READ THEM!
=========

- Check https://roguetech.gamepedia.com/Performance_Tips for Performance Tipps

- If an update fails, try first to reboot your PC. Windows probably locks some dll and the patcher cant overwrite it

- Combat saves and mission restarts are permanently disabled

- Loading a save from inside the career/battle fails sometimes. Restarting the game before loading saves is recommended

- Randomly occurring duplicated defaults or default/fixed equipment making mech invalid - store and ready the mech to fix.

- Not being able to hire pilots/pilots don't appear in barracks after hiring - save and reload before hiring to fix

- May crash when alt-tabbing during modtek load

- Pilot portraits staying blue after using sensor lock, known issue, no fix

- Cannot deploy during first contract - Save and reload to fix

- Purple mechs, purle ECM bubbles - shaders failed to initialize, happens randomly, try waiting before pressing begin combat after mission loads

- RogueTech for linux requires some extra steps as outlined on the wiki install guide

- Purple artillery explosions, purple fires - shaders fail to link on Linux/Mac, select "Old Fire" in the installer

- Mission Control can sometimes take its time to find a drop spot when randomized spawns are enabled

- Flashpoints are not affected by Mission Control and your second lance will not drop

- Clicking deploy button does nothing - remove warnings on your mechs. Yes, even the underweight one. Yes, even if you deployed a 1000 times with it

- If you go into career and cant open the mechbay.  Restart your game. If that failed, Please make a ticket

- Item effects descriptions are not displayed in the mechlab - restart the game without updating, happens after update

- Ams laser animation sometimes doesn't go away.  We are sending in comstar security to arrest it for indecent ams laser exposure.

- Weapon panel sometimes doesn't appear when selecting a mech. Pressing escape to Deselect and trying again a couple times generally fixes it.

- Do NOT! use the older steam overlay, it crashes HBSBT 1.9

- Some variant weapons have a name ending in (Deprecated).  This is only a bug if you see them in salvage after a mission Any you have still work. We're changing the way we handle weapon variants. The deprecated ones are being phased out of future versions.

- Do not touch pilots stats while they are fatigued or injured. If you did, retrain pilot to get skills working again.

- Knockdowns/Overheating can cause Zombie mechs that are dead, but do not count towards mission completion, fixes are in the works.

- Overheat+Knockdown at the same time can cause softlock when done to a player mech

- Certain specific pilots start gaining massive amounts of exp as they approach fully leveled up. (Integer overflow with bonus exp quirks)

- Vehicles with no Turret location can appear to take structure damage when still have armor. This is a visual glitch only.

- On some Base Destroy missons it may look like your kills doesnt count toward objectives, but they actually do and objectives will update after you get close to the base and trigger enemy reinforcments.

- Mech that falls as a result of minefield explosions could end at the same hex as other mech and become untargetable, cant be fixed unfortunatelly, use AOE weapons to kill it.

- Offline mode is unsupported currently, as GaW developer burned out. Please do not report any bugs with contract generation/system ownership in offline mode, we cant fix them.
   You can fix most of this issues by flipping "ResetMap": to true in GalaxyAtWar/mod.json. Disable safelaunch, start game, advance time, save, close, revert ResetMap back to false. 

- All careers started between mid january (1.1.0.0) and 1.1.1.3 will experience problems on online map with priority missions not generating and results not posting when in a direct jump vicinity of certain star system (with non-ascii names). 
   Unfortunately this bug cannot be fixed in existing career.

**RogueTech Treadnought**

After over 6 Months of Work, and many hours of curses and codemares we proudly present

RogueTech Codename: Operation Treadnought!

The long awaited Tank update!

Crush your enemys under a merciless assault of Demolishers or teach them the horrors of a VTOL Swarm

YOUR OSMIUM SAVES CANNOT BE USED WITH THIS VERSION!

PLAYABLE TANKS!
-Players can now field, buy and salvage tanks!
-These have received a complete overhaul to be completely inline with CBT rules to the last kilogram
-You can now drop up to 12 units at 800 tons (argo upgrades permitting), with 4 of these being restricted to tanks
-Tanks cannot be modified but they offer new tactical options or just sheer firepower
-Toggle in Mechlab between Vehicle and Mechbay

Online Map has returned!
-Including several anti cheat measures and ability to ban exploiters
-You can appeal a autoban by making a ticket on Discord

Complete Skill System and Background Overhaul
-You now have a choice of 2 Abilities at Skill level 5 and 8
-Level 8 Skills are Active Cooldown Based options
-Earn Affinities with Mechs by using them for longer battles
-Training pods reduce and prevent affinity decay
-You Commander now has Quirks!
-Commander Background equipment is granted at day 2

Complete Overhaul of the Shops System
-Shops now have 3 components:
-All shops now stock basic equipment (a mix of introtech weapons, upgrades/heatsinks, ammo, engine cores) in expanded quantities alongside small amounts of uncommon ammo and special slot upgrades (e.g. bolt on weapons) with medium or large population planets offering a wider selection than small population ones.
-As you gain rep, the shops will adjust (only on planet change. Stores are static until you change). At liked rep, you'll see a small number of new tanks (succession wars era) added to the stores, at friendly levels; the faction will sell you some mech parts and at honoured rep; they will offer a random mech for sale (both the mech and the mech parts will also be succesion wars era vintage). Please note that this depends on planet tags so a small population planet will only offer extra tanks, but more populous planets will offer the full range of gear.
-The 3rd component in the new shop system is planet tags. These largely remain the same for the moment, but manufacturing planets will sell 2 random advanced (as in post Helm Core tech) tanks and mining will sell 2 random Succession Wars era tanks.
      
-Shops now stock dlc mechs/mech parts if you own/install the relevant dlc (e.g. flashpoint might put a Crab in your shop)
      
-Installing the Piratetech mod will now offer rare piratetech in the system stores of the major Pirate factions (Valkyrate/Oberon/Circinus/Tortuga) and some piratetech vehicles/mechs in their faction stores.
      
-Faction shops now exist for all factions. These will stock a selection of advanced tanks and mechs/mech parts alongside things like xl engines or endo steel and other upgrades.
      
-Several factions do have slightly different stores/faction stores. WoB and Comstar will stock SLDF Royals in their faction store and occasionally non Royal SLDF mechs in their system stores. 
-Clans will sell Royals and Second Line mechs alongside mostly SLDF era weapons/ equipment in their stores. Clan tech and weapons will be more common as you advance in rep. Faction stores for the clans will sell Omnimechs in place of standard mechs. 
-The Deep Periphery factions such as New Delphi will have smaller stores representing their lower tech levels. They will also be tilted towards a mix of introtech equipment and primititve weapons alogside early mechs and tanks. 

Overhauled Melee System
-Melee now has proper hit locations and types
-Majority of your Weapons may fire during Melee Attacks
-Punches hit the upper locations of a mech and prevent arm mounted weapons from firing
-Charge is a devastating melee attack at sprint distance that deals damage based on weight and distance, no weapons may fire
-Kicks allow to target a mechs legs and prevent leg mounted weapons from firing 
-Physical Melee weapons have unique pro's and con's, use a Mace to ruin their stability or go Headhunting with Swords

Notable Changes:
-New Performance fixes, massive improvements to almost everything!
-Manual Deployments! A Option to chose where you want to drop your forces in Battle
-Overhauled Minefields
-Improved Weapons and Ammo UI
-Overhauled Weapons Crit System. Depending on weapontype and size, they can receive multiple crits before being destroyed
-So many many many changes, often backported to osmium during development

Notable Minor issues
-Ammo based weapons show a 0 in Mechlab. This is for internal Ammo which they dont have. Fix coming soon.

IMPORTANT! CLEAN INSTALL REQUIRED!
Install has been split into 2!
The Core and the Asset bundle

Core has all files for the mechanics, options and submods

Asset bundle contains ALL! REQUIRED! data for the mech models themself

This is to ensure a lower download size for single patches and hotfixes

-----
HIGHLIGHT:
-----

Low Visibility introduction - Double Blind rules!
A greater importance on information warfare and stealth
Anything now plays a role in it, from the Weather to the pilots ability to see

https://github.com/IceRaptor/LowVisibility

At the start of every move a unit makes a sensor check (tactics skill)
This defines what it can see and to what detail
The distance and strength of this check is affected by Sensor Probes (like the Beagle Active Probe)
Countered is this by Stealth and ECM 
roughly: Pilot Skill+Roll+Probe Tier -Ecm -Stealth

You can see what your rolls and modifiers are in among your buff icons!

Introduces advanced sensors and items like UAV, Thermal Vision and Advanced Zoom to help find the enemy and deduce the threat

Low Vis Guide and tips coming to the wiki soon!

SBI patch
- Fixes init overflow bug (init values below 1 return ERROR). Please let me know if you see cases where actors skip their turn.
- Changes CalledShot to apply a penalty equal to your (Gunnery + Tactics)/2 + Random(0, 2) rounded down. This is resisted by the target's piloting skill, and can be reduced to 0. 
- Changes Vigiliance to apply a bonus to initiative on the following round equal to your (Guts + Tactics)/2, rounded down.
- Tier 5 and Tier 8 skills each provide +1 modifier to the relevant skill modifier.

996 FP Compat Patch 1

NOT SAVE COMPATIBLE TO ANYTHING!
REQUIRES CLEAN INSTALL!

Initiative overhaul - https://github.com/IceRaptor/SkillBasedInit
Initiative is now based upon pilots skills, chassis weights, gear and spiced with rng
Some items got tweaked for this function

Weapon Jamming
Weapons can now Jam 
Each level of gunnery above 1 adds 10% chance to avoid a weapon jam and each level adds 10% to unjam. So a level 10 gunnery pilot would have a 90% chance to avoid a weapon jam and a 100% chance to unjam on the next round.
Jamming is based upon recoil of a weapon, reducing recoil also prevents jamming 

New Pilots
Elite Pilots - Highly trained and skilled pilots with unique nicknames
Named Pilots - Elite pilots with extra traits and a unique buff (very WIP)
Tanker Crews - Tanks now have their own selection of "crews", tuned for tank action
New contracts - You are challenged to a duel by a lance of elite pilots

Jamming is based upon recoil of a weapon, reducing recoil also prevents jamming 

RAC gained improved ranges, damage and heat, but highest chance to jam

Jumping will make you even less accurate
Accuracy mods (cumulative)
+1 for moving, +2 sprinting, +3for jumping

Melee accuracy reduced

Being in overheat will give you a escalating penalty to accuracy, ammo explosion and shutdown per turn

        "ShutdownPercentages": [0.042, 0.139, 0.292, 0.416],
        "AmmoExplosionPercentages": [0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.28],
        "HeatToHitModifiers": [1, 2, 3, 4]

Being pushed beyond the stability threshhold will only knock you down on a stability check dependant on piloting skill
