CHANGELOG!
=========
KNOWN ISSUES
=========

-Check https://roguetech.gamepedia.com/Performance_Tips for Performance Tipps

- Combat saves are permanently disabled to prevent severe bugs

- If you get stuck at modtek done screen for a longer period, this is an issue of vanilla not initiating properly, try deleting .modtek folder (mostly not rt related)

- Priority contracts randomly fail to load. We cant reproduce why or even get it among the team. Whoever finds a true reproducible commonality please help.

- Randomly occurring duplicated defaults - Store and ready the mech to fix, ultra rare issue

- Shops populate only after first contract on a planet- is being worked on

- Sometimes there are visible health bars on remains, This is a vanilla bug and causes no real issues

- Not being able to hire pilots, company not fully initialized, save and reload or spend xp, yet another vanilla bug

- absence of burned trees on reaching limit

- may crash when alt-tabbing during modtek load (can be alleviated by using windowed mode)

- Pilot portraits staying blue after using sensor lock, known issue, cause not found yet

- Cannot deploy during first contract = company not fully initialized = save and reload or spend xp, yet another vanilla bug

- Colourcoding in Inventory Screen failing, no cause found yet

- Valiant doesnt have Textures yet, it was that or a broken bundle, will be fixed in due time

- RogueTech for linux requires some extra steps as outlined on the wiki install guide

- Targeting VTOLs doesn't work right if they are in the same hex as another unit. Use TAB to select targets.

- Mission Control can sometimes take its time to find a drop spot

- Flashpoints are not affected by Mission Control and your second lance will not drop. This is intentional UI rework in progress.

- When stuck in loading career, enter skimrish mechbay once

- To generate all available contracts, open the contracts screen twice

- After upgrading additional lance slots. Safe and reload to properly initialize them.

- Game fails to Launch roguetech on a first start or a updated setting. Restart the launcher, hard reset, update and launch again.

========

Known Issue

Patch 997 Release

IMPORTANT! CLEAN INSTALL REQUIRED!

The Core and the Asset bundle

Core has all files for the mechanics, options and submods

Asset bundle contains ALL! REQUIRED! data for the mech models themself

This is to ensure a lower download size for single patches and hotfixes

-----
HIGHLIGHT:
-----

Low Visibility introduction - Double Blind rules!
A greater importance on information warfare and stealth
Anything now plays a role in it, from the Weather to the pilots ability to see

https://github.com/IceRaptor/LowVisibility

At the start of every move a unit makes a sensor check (tactics skill)
This defines what it can see and to what detail
The distance and strength of this check is affected by Sensor Probes (like the Beagle Active Probe)
Countered is this by Stealth and ECM 
roughly: Pilot Skill+Roll+Probe Tier -Ecm -Stealth

You can see what your rolls and modifiers are in among your buff icons!

Introduces advanced sensors and items like UAV, Thermal Vision and Advanced Zoom to help find the enemy and deduce the threat

Low Vis Guide and tips coming to the wiki soon!

- Fixes init overflow bug (init values below 1 return ERROR). Please let me know if you see cases where actors skip their turn.
- Changes CalledShot to apply a penalty equal to your (Gunnery + Tactics)/2 + Random(0, 2) rounded down. This is resisted by the target's piloting skill, and can be reduced to 0.

- POSSIBLE Fixes to broken save/loads due to initiative (Can take quite some time to actually load the save) (will not fix already broken combat saves)



996 FP Compat Patch 1

NOT SAVE COMPATIBLE TO ANYTHING!
REQUIRES CLEAN INSTALL!

Initiative overhaul - https://github.com/IceRaptor/SkillBasedInit
Initiative is now based upon pilots skills, chassis weights, gear and spiced with rng
Some items got tweaked for this function

Weapon Jamming
Weapons can now Jam 
Each level of gunnery above 1 adds 10% chance to avoid a weapon jam and each level adds 10% to unjam. So a level 10 gunnery pilot would have a 90% chance to avoid a weapon jam and a 100% chance to unjam on the next round.
Jamming is based upon recoil of a weapon, reducing recoil also prevents jamming 

New Pilots
Elite Pilots - Highly trained and skilled pilots with unique nicknames
Named Pilots - Elite pilots with extra traits and a unique buff (very WIP)
Tanker Crews - Tanks now have their own selection of "crews", tuned for tank action
New contracts - You are challenged to a duel by a lance of elite pilots

Jamming is based upon recoil of a weapon, reducing recoil also prevents jamming 

RAC gained improved ranges, damage and heat, but highest chance to jam

- all sold items go into faction inventory of the planet owner
- every 30 minutes a new shop is generated from the inventory
- a bought item is removed from the shop of that faction for EVERY Player( Only one can buy item)

- MRB rep shops still work the same
