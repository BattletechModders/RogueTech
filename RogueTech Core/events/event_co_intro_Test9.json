Sumire groans. \"This doesn't always happen, Commander, I swear...\"\r\n\r\nA voice echoes unexpectedly through the broken buildings. \"These odds aren't very fair. I hope you don't mind if I even them up.\" A man steps out from the shadows on the far side of the smugglers, dressed outlandishly in the style of a Star League era movie star, but brandishing two gleaming pistols.\r\n\r\nTwo smugglers spin in the gunslinger's direction, then immediately crumple to the dirt, with a spray of blood and an echo of gunshots. After a fusillade of bullets from your and Sumire's sidearms, a third enemy crumples lifelessly. The remaining smugglers flee toward their vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe gunslinger holsters his pistols in a dextrous flourish. \"You look out of place without your Mech, Commander.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh, have we met?\" asks Sumire.\r\n\r\nThe man laughs. \"No. I just have a good eye for warriors who have forgotten their swords.\"",
