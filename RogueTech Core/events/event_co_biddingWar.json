So I did a little research on market opportunities.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've heard back from two potential customers in {TGT_SYSTEM.Name} orbit. One would pay cash for the fresh food. I think I can get ¢75,000, give or take. The other is offering machine tools in trade, which the Mech Bay could use to boost productivity.\"\r\n\r\nDarius looks longingly at his basket. \"All offers require a minimum supply of produce, though, and it'll take more than our surplus to fill them. The crew won't like limits on their salad bar.\"",

With a smug look, he shoves a datapad in your hands.\r\n\r\nAs you scan the deals, you whistle. \"Are you serious?\"\r\n\r\nDarius nods. \"These people are so isolated and so desperate for fresh produce, it was almost unfair. In the end, I played both buyers off against each other and managed to convince each of them to settle for half of what we were willing to sell.\"\r\n\r\nCringing at the thought of having to negotiate against Darius, you nod firmly. \"I can't in good conscience turn down this deal. Tell Sumire to grab some bodies and load up the food.\"",
