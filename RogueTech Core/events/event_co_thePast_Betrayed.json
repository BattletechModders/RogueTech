Rance was a family bodyguard who'd abandoned his post on that fateful night, long ago, when your family was betrayed. You killed him for it.\r\n\r\nBut that's Rance stumbling into your table. \"Hey,\" he slurs. \"Can you spare any C-bills? I have to get offworld. I need to stay a step ahead of the devil!\"\r\n\r\nAmused, Darius prompts the drunk with, \"What does the devil want with you?\"\r\n\r\nRance freezes like a prey animal. \"Revenge! {COMMANDER.Callsign} wants revenge!\"",
