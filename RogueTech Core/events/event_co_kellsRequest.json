He's a living legend.\" Dr. Murad smiles widely. \"Unfortunately, there aren't many records on how four-hundred-year-old technology works. I know it's a lot to ask, but if you can grant me one week, a half-million C-Bills, and a dozen Mech Techs, I think we can really help him. Not a bad potential ally, right?\"",
