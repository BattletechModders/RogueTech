Sprained my ankle pretty good.\"\r\n\r\nDespite {TGT_MW.DET} injures, {TGT_MW.SUBJ} managed to mount the telescopic camera on the <i>Argo</i>'s hull. While the high fidelity display draws a number of viewers, most of the crew crowds around {TGT_MW.Callsign} in the MedBay. They're clamoring to know how {TGT_MW.SUBJ} survived.\r\n\r\n\"This is going to sound ridiculous, but an old spacer taught me this trick,\" {TGT_MW.Callsign} says. \"Duct tape, of all things, actually forms a durable seal. Bought me enough time to climb back to the airlock.\"\r\n\r\nThe story causes nearly every crew member to keep a roll of duct tape handy at all times for the next couple weeks as spirits rise and new uses for the tape keep getting discovered.",
