The sound of cheers and pounding metal draws you to the edge of town, where a pair of haphazardly repaired industrial 'Mechs beat on each other.\r\n\r\nYang calls you over. \"Sorry I wandered off, Boss. I heard a guy in the market bragging about this AgroMech fight club. I had to see it for myself.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the 'Mechs is in notably better condition than the other, but the second clearly has the better -- or possibly drunker -- pilot. The shinier 'Mech finally falls, and a small group of winning bettors collects from the bookie.\r\n\r\nYang gestures to the junkier 'Mech as the cockpit opens. \"You have to meet this pilot. He said 'any AgroMech can be made combat ready, if you\u2019re not afraid of the challenge.' What do you say, shall we buy the victor a drink?\"",
