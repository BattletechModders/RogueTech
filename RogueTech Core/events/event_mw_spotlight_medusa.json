This is a message for Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}. We wanted to thank-you for what you've done here in {TGT_SYSTEM.Name}.\"\r\n\r\nHe pauses and with encouragement from his wife continues. \"And ah... we've heard that our boy is working for you. He goes by [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]]? We were hoping you could contact us and tell us how he's doing. When he left us, we didn't really part on the best of terms. He hasn't talked to us for a long time. But recent events... well, you know. We miss him and we'd really appreciate it if you could give us a little bit of news.\"",
