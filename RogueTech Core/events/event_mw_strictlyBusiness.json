The XO stomps over, pulling you and [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] aside. \"Unbelievable! Today, {TGT_MW.Callsign} racked up a huge debt—two million C-bills—at a crime syndicate’s gambling ring and had the gall to run out on 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what you're talking about.\" {TGT_MW.Callsign}'s gaze flickers toward the stranger.\r\n\r\nDarius points to a video feed on the stranger's compad. On the screen, {TGT_MW.Callsign} climbs out the window of a seedy industrial structure. \"They want their money, but they'll accept {TGT_MW.Callsign} in lieu of cash. It's 'strictly business,' he assured me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't afford to pay that back. Let's take off!\" {TGT_MW.Callsign} blurts out. \"Forget this creep.\"\r\n\r\nDarius grabs {TGT_MW.Callsign} by the arm. \"Pipe down, Card Shark. This is the Commander's call. These <i>gentlemen</i> are tied to pirates all over the Periphery. We might piss off a whole slew of bad guys if we bolt.\"",
