It's for a local collector. He's got his own personal zoo and also happens to have a cache of slightly used mechs. He'll part with a Mech for the right incentive. All I need are some extra hands\u2014[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] will do\u2014and the funds to buy the bird. Then, I can trade it to this eccentric billionaire.
