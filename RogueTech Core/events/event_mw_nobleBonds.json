Something about cooling systems. {SCN_MW.Subj_C} {TGT_MW.Gender?NonBinary:want|Default:wants} me to use my 'connections' to get the idea to people who can implement it. And {SCN_MW.Subj} {TGT_MW.Gender?NonBinary:don't|Default:doesn't} believe me when I say that my birth doesn't automatically open doors like that. And even if it did, I can't waste it on bullshit.\" {TGT_MW.Callsign} gives you a plaintive look, clearly hoping for advice, or at least sympathy.",
