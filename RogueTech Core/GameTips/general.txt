Ammo explodes. Don't have too much of it. Also, don't run out of ammo. But you do you, chief.
Untrained Mechwarriors are more likely to panic. Punch through their armor to make them reach for the Eject button. 
Scare your enemy into bailing out! Destroying their allies, flanking, and reducing their offensive capability all lead to panic.
The danger zones in a DropShip landing area are no joke, no matter what your fellow Mechwarriors say.

Active Probes boost your sensor check, improving the information you see about enemies at longer ranges.

Failure is not an option - it is mandatory. The option is whether or not to let failure be the last thing you do.
The most important mantra you can learn: 'Guns off the field.' If you can remove a target do so. Ignore salvage. Ignore target priority. Make it gone.
Get eyes on the blips as quickly as possible. You NEED to know if that 100-ton blip is Gausszilla or a Mackie.

If you install an ECM, NSS or Stealth armor you might feel like a ninja dodging every shot, but remember: one good hit and you are dead meat
If you need some quick c-bills, scrap some of the 'Mech chassis parts you have. Drop them into the trash compactor and milk some money out of them. You can sell extra weaponry as well.
Always keep an eye on your expenses. If you overspend, don't be surprised if you can't afford the next electricity bill.
Sometimes a bigger or smaller core is better for your 'Mech. Don't be afraid to experiment and see what you need. If you have a fire support 'Mech, it won't need a big-ass core for melee anyway.
If you are in a tight spot you can try to wrap up the mission by completing only the main objective then escaping. If it isn't possible, sometimes withdrawing in bad faith is better than losing your lance completely.

If I had a C-Bill for every time the mission briefing was accurate; I might have one C-Bill - Sumire
If all goes according to plan, you are almost certainly walking into an ambush.
The funny thing about routine missions, is that those are the ones where everything goes south.
Expectations are what get you killed faster than anything else. Plan for things not to go according to plan. 
Move your enemy. Do not let them move you. If you dictate the location of the fight you are halfway to victory.
To be wise is to realize that you know almost nothing, and that what you do know may be false. 
Complex does not mean competent, and the most damning fool of all is an educated fool.
Never make anything simple and efficient when a way can be found to make it complex and wonderful.
The totally convinced and the totally stupid have too much in common for the resemblance to be accidental.
