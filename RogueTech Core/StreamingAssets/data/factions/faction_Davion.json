    "We have a job for you, Mercenary scum. As distasteful as that is to us.",
    "Mercenary though you may be, you seem effective enough. House Davion has need of your skills, Commander.",
    "Greetings, Commander. House Davion requires aid from someone outside of our own forces. Hopefully you can help us.",
    "House Davion requires mercenaries of skill, Commander, and you fit the bill nicely. With luck, we will both profit from this arrangement.",
    "You have served us well in the past, Commander. We value this relationship, and would like to preserve it.",
    "Greetings, Commander. Once again, House Davion requires your services. Should you be successful, we will both profit.",
    "Honored friend! Your acts in service to House Davion have not been forgotten. In light of this, we present you with this choice contract."
  ],
  "MissionSuccessStatement": "Excellent performance, Commander. The Federated Suns are pleased with what you have accomplished and the skill you've evidenced. Expect our payment in full!",
  "GoodFaithFailureStatement": "Well, let it never be said House Davion does not believe in charity. Obviously, your skills could not be equivalent to our own regular armies—so we do not blame you for your inability to complete the contract.",
  "BadFaithFailureStatement": "Come now, mercenary—did you even try to complete the contract, or did you believe we'd pay you for your own inadequacies? Such a dismal performance cannot be rewarded, only reprimanded.",
  "Description" : "The Federated Suns is one of the five Successor States of the Star League, located rimward and spinward of Terra. Ruled by House Davion, the Federation is the most powerful of the five, and the people of the Federation pride themselves on their self-proclaimed role as defenders of justice and liberty. The Federation is quite capable of ruthless, decisive action, though, and its idealism readily gives way to pragmatism when called for. The current ruler of the Federation, Prince Hanse Davion, is an experienced and unconventional military commander. The Federation's alliance with the Lyran Commonwealth effectively ended the Third Succession War."
