  "Description" : "The Rimward Frontier is a hotbed of simmering hostilities, piracy, and low-intensity skirmishes. In this environment, MechWarriors with more guts than sense can carve out a living for themselves as independent mercenaries. The pay is good, but the survival rate is very, very low."
