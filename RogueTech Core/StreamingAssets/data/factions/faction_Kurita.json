    "Despicable as you are, House Kurita can still find a use for your services. Attend, Commander: your betters have need of you.",

    "You are not of our blood, mercenary, but your skills are robust enough. We would grant you money and renown if you aided us.",
    "House Kurita respects your martial prowess, mercenary. Aid us, and we will ensure you are well paid for your efforts.",
    "Once again, the Draconis Combine requires your assistance, mercenary. You have served us well in the past, so we would like to entrust you with this mission.",
    "My friend, you know we bring you only the contracts worthy of your talents. So it is that I offer you this—and payment that you will find is more than fair.",
    "I apologize for disturbing you, my friend, but the Draconis Combine once again needs your help. Undertake this task for us, and I will see that you are richly rewarded."

  "MissionSuccessStatement": "The Draconis Combine is pleased with your fervor, Commander. Your skills in battle are precisely the sort that young cadets could learn from.",
  "GoodFaithFailureStatement": "While your retreat would be grounds for censure in one of our soldiers, we understand that a mercenary life is more… complicated. We hope it will not become a habit, however.",
  "BadFaithFailureStatement": "Your performance was an embarrassment, Commander. The Draconis Combine expects more of their mercenaries. Keep this up, and we may not offer you any contracts at all!",
  "Description" : "The Draconis Combine is one of the five Successor States of the Star League, located coreward and spinward of Terra. Ruled by House Kurita, the Combine has always been aggressively expansionist—the head of the Combine was the first of the Council Lords to declare himself the new ruler of the collapsing Star League. Regularly in conflicts along its borders with all its neighbors, the Combine is a highly structured, militaristic society, with rulership in the hands of the Coordinator, the commander-in-chief of the Draconis military. The Combine's culture is heavily influenced by the Japanese roots of the ruling family—despite the minority status of those with Japanese ancestry—as this cultural heritage is imposed from above by the predominantly Japanese ruling class. The current leader of the Combine is Coordinator Takashi Kurita."
