        "Commander, if you have been attacking the planets of Nueva Castile for money, we can offer you similar contracts that will preserve our independence, and I beg you to consider this one.",
        "Welcome to Nueva Castile, Commander.  I have a task for you to undertake, if you would like to help preserve our independence.  You will of course be adequately compensated for your efforts.",
        "Thank you again for your help in protecting Nueva Castile's independence, Commander.  We would like to employ you once more to defend our sovereignty and independence, if you are able?",
        "Welcome friend of Nueva Castile.  You have helped us many times in the past, and hope you can take on this contract to assist us in preserving our independence once more.",

    "Description": "Nueva Castile isn't actually a faction per se, but more a typical outer periphery area in flux.  It is lacking in HPG stations, and so far out of touch with the rest of the inner sphere that hardly anyone knows what's really going on there."
