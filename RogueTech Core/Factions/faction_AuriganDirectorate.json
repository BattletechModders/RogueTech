  "ShortName": "the Directorate",
  "Description": "The Aurigan Directorate replaced the Aurigan Coalition when Santiago Espinosa, adviser to the High Lady Kamea Arano, betrayed her and led a coup against her government. In the years since that coup, Director Espinosa has solidified his hold on the systems of the Directorate, binding the Founding Families to his cause with a mixture of promises and threats. His rule is oppressive and militaristic, with individual liberties sacrificed to the cause of security and stability.",

    "You are a villain and a scoundrel, and you are unworthy of even the slightest consideration. Even so, our own forces are greatly weakened at this moment—so we're willing to entertain employing you.",
    "Desperate times call for desperate measures. We wouldn't be asking to hire you unless we had no other choice. Hopefully you can help us.",
    "Times are changing, Commander. There is a need in the Directorate for one of your skills. Contracts like this one will pave a way for your future, through us. That future need not be dark.",
    "A rising tide lifts all ships, Commander. House Espinosa is rising quite quickly. Continue to work for us, and we'll ensure you continue to be a prominent figure in the Reach.",
    "I must say, at this rate I'll soon be calling you a friend, Commander. The Directorate's fortunes are rosy, thanks in no small part to you. Let's continue our relationship, shall we?",
    "Our influence spreads, as do our garrisons. Your help has been invaluable in this, Commander—and we would like to offer you more work, providing you are not already overwhelmed. Let us know soon, please.",
    "My friend, I hope this missive finds you well. House Espinosa trusts and values MechWarriors such as yourself and those of your company. This contract is one for only our most esteemed allies, and I do hope you will accept it."
