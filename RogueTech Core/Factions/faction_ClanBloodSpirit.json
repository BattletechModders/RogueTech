    "Freeborn mercenary, the Blood Spirits have faced you in battle before.  Take up this batchall and perhaps we can find a more common purpose.",
    "Freeborn, you are an unknown to us.  Prove yourself on the field of battle with this batchall, and we may have further use of you.",
    "Freeborn, you have assisted the Blood Spirits in the past.  Continue to be useful by taking up this batchall and we might continue this relationship.",
    "Freeborn, I must admit I am warming to you, as you have proven yourself to be useful to the Blood Spirits.  We offer you this batchall in recognition of your service.",
    "Greetings freeborn.  You have helped the Blood Spirits greatly, and in recognition of your service, I offer you this batchall I had reserved for our own warriors."

    "Your cowardice is as much as I expect from a Freeborn. Your lack of honour deserves far more than a lack of payment."

  "Description": "Named for the esprit-de-corps that bound the original 800 Clan warriors, Clan Blood Spirit ironically became the most isolationist and bitter of the Clans. They believed that the other Clans had abandoned the way set down by Nicholas Kerensky.",
