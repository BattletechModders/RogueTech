        "Freeborn, we have met in combat before, and you have proven yourself moderately competent, if faithless.  Return to The Way, and take up this batchall against our foes",
        "Freeborn, you are an unknown to us.  Prove yourself on the field of battle with this batchall, and we may have further use of you.",

    "BadFaithFailureStatements": [
        "You have failed.  You do not follow The Way, you have no honour, and God has averted his eyes from you.  I suggest you meditate on your failures and pray for forgiveness before you contact us again."
