        "Commander, the Hanseatic League is a mercantile alliance; we are traders.  Rather than attack us, let us work together for mutual benefit.",
        "Greetings Commander.  The Hanseatic League has a task requiring a lance of mercenaries such as yours, shall we negotiate on a payment for your services?",
        "Greetings again Commander.  The Hanseatic League once again have a small matter you can assist with, if you would care to negotiate a mutually agreeable payment?",
        "Hello again, friend of the Hanseatic League.  I have kept this profitable contract aside in hopes of meeting with you, shall we discuss it further?",
