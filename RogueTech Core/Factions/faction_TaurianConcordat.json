  "Name": "the Taurian Concordat",
  "ShortName": "the Taurians",
  "Description": "The Taurian Concordat is one of the largest Periphery states, located rimward of Terra, beyond the Federated Suns. Founded and ruled by House Calderon, the Concordat prides itself on its independence, freedom, and stability. The Concordat is wealthy, well educated, and well armed for a Periphery state. The Taurians defend their independence fiercely against Inner Sphere aggression, particularly by the Federated Suns; they perceive House Davion's reputation as a protector of liberties as unwarranted and even hypocritical, and they have a long history of conflict with the much larger Successor State. The current ruler of the Concordat is Protector Thomas Calderon.",

    "In an earlier era, House Calderon would have had you killed rather than offer you a contract. Unfortunately, we don't live in that earlier era—and also, we need a disposable soldier. Accept or not; I don't care.",
    "I dislike your kind, mercenary. But it seems that desperate times force compromises on all of us. Bear that in mind should you accept this contract: we offer it to you only because we have no other choice. Tread carefully.",
    "Greetings, Commander. This is a standard contract, and we expect you to be able to complete it with competence. Try to look grateful, if you accept it.",
    "This contract may be of interest to you, Commander. The Taurian Concordat believes it within your ability to complete, and in times like these, we are willing to pay you well to see it done. Please let us know.",
    "Hello, mercenary. The Taurian Concordat values our relationship, and so we would like to offer you first right of refusal on this contract. The job is simple, and the pay adequate. We know it to be within your capabilities as well.",
    "My friend, I've got good news: House Calderon needs your help, and we've got plenty of money to pay for that help. We know you've got the skills to see this job done, and any help would be appreciated by my superiors.",
    "House Calderon would once again like to call upon you, our faithful janissary, ready to wage war in our name wherever we ask. Once more we ask you to join the fray on our behalf—and as always, we value your loyalty."
