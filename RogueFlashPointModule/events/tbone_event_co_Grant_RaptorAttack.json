I've always suspected they were really pirates and it looks like they finally crossed the line. For years I've hoped to have a chance at taking them down, but they've always proved too clever. No more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[TooltipSimGameCharacterDARIUS],Darius]] looks over the bulletin, his eyes twinkling as he gets to the numbers at the bottom. \"Say the word Commander, and we'll hit the Raptors hard and collect this bounty. Should be a pretty good payday! The bounty is set at 250,000 c-bills on top of whatever we can salvage on-site.\"",
