All through school she was that kid who stayed after class to hound the music or drama teachers to give her extra lessons, or watch her perform a piece. As her family was not of very high standing within the Federated Suns, someone like her had to grab for every opportunity possible. With each begged-for lesson or guilt-tripped critique, her talents grew, and so did her knowledge that all it would take was being discovered, and she'd become the new media darling of Davion space; maybe even beyond.\r\n\r\nIn her later teen years Avelynn saw something that would change her life, and her plans; she bore witness to the agility and grace possible in a Battlemech while watching a vid of the Noisiel Summer Games.

Center stage belongs to Glam, after all.";"Avelynn Dupré was born knowing she wanted to be a star. From the time she could walk she danced, and from the time she could talk she sang. All through school she was that kid who stayed after class to hound the music or drama teachers to give her extra lessons, or watch her perform a piece. As her family was not of very high standing within the Federated Suns, someone like her had to grab for every opportunity possible. With each begged-for lesson or guilt-tripped critique, her talents grew, and so did her knowledge that all it would take was being discovered, and she'd become the new media darling of Davion space; maybe even beyond.

In her later teen years Avelynn saw something that would change her life, and her plans; she bore witness to the agility and grace possible in a Battlemech while watching a vid of the Noisiel Summer Games. From this came her obession with Battlemechs, and combining them with music and dance to create something she thought would take the Inner Sphere by storm; to see a choreographed show of nimble 'Mechs set to music of her own production.

"pilot_jk_Garrisoned.Description.Details";"Garrison is a true son of Arcturus, the one time capital system of the Lyran Commonwealth and like any good citizen of the Commonwealth, he joined the military as soon as he was of age.  He tested well in the VR-pods and was promptly sent to Coventry Military Academy.  There he excelled in his tactics classes and was put on a fast track for being assigned to a line unit to replace the ever increasing losses during the 3rd Succession War.  Being given an early commission with the severely depleted Sixth Arcturian Guards, Garrison was sent to Starshine at the age of 21.\r\n\r\nOn Starshine he was assigned to be First Leutnant of a Support Lance where he was able to make excellent use of his academy training against pirate raiders and Free Worlds League units.  Where is Starshine you may ask?  Well, don't bother looking for it on star maps, its a dead world now.  What about the Sixth Arcturian Guards?  They no longer show on the rolls of active units for the Commonwealth - yet Garrison was there at the end of both.\r\n\r\nBarely a year into his new assignment, Garrison was thrust right into action.  During the Marik Civil War of 3014 (also known as Anton's Revolt), the Commonwealth decided to take advantage of the situation and sent the Sixth in to raid Griffith.  With the chaos of Anton's Revolt, the 1st Fusiliers of Oriente were slow to respond and the Sixth's raid was considered a rousing success.  During the fighting Garrison would bait the enemy into terrain of his choosing to allow his support lance to pepper the opposing force with indirect fire while performing slow withdrawals toward the other lances in his company.  The Hauptmann of the company took to saying the OpFor got 'Garrisoned' and it wasn't long before it stuck as his call sign.\r\n\r\nReturning to their post at Starshine, the Sixth was celebrating their victory in one of the larger domed habitats when the Fusiliers got their revenge.  Performing a Hover-Drop, a mobile force of Fusiliers attacked, catching the Sixth completely unaware.  Scrambling to get back to his 'Mech, Garrison found he was cut off by the Fusiliers' forces.  Over the next few days he bided his time until opportunity knocked in he form of a Fusiliers Hunchback 4P that was left in the old Sixth depot area for repairs.  Subduing the technicians, Garrison took control of the 'Mech and made to escape the depot.  There are many stories about what happened next, but the one thing every story has in common is that the depot was set off, causing a chain reaction that destroyed the Star League era air purifying system that kept the planetary domes habitable.  This ultimately led to the world being abandoned of the next few years, another casualty of the Succession Wars.\r\n\r\nWhile the 1st Fusiliers of Oriente made it off world mostly intact, the same could not be said for the Sixth, between their losses during the surprise assault, and the destruction of the depot - the Sixth ceased to be a solvent unit.

But Garrisoned is a skilled Tactician and he has a plan to get back in the game, even if he has had to take his lumps as a merc for nearly a decade.";"Garrison is a true son of Arcturus, the one time capital system of the Lyran Commonwealth and like any good citizen of the Commonwealth, he joined the military as soon as he was of age. He tested well in the VR-pods and was promptly sent to Coventry Military Academy. There he excelled in his tactics classes and was put on a fast track for being assigned to a line unit to replace the ever increasing losses during the 3rd Succession War. Being given an early commission with the severely depleted Sixth Arcturian Guards, Garrison was sent to Starshine at the age of 21.

On Starshine he was assigned to be First Leutnant of a Support Lance where he was able to make excellent use of his academy training against pirate raiders and Free Worlds League units. Where is Starshine you may ask? Well, don't bother looking for it on star maps, its a dead world now. What about the Sixth Arcturian Guards? They no longer show on the rolls of active units for the Commonwealth - yet Garrison was there at the end of both.

Barely a year into his new assignment, Garrison was thrust right into action. During the Marik Civil War of 3014 (also known as Anton's Revolt), the Commonwealth decided to take advantage of the situation and sent the Sixth in to raid Griffith. With the chaos of Anton's Revolt, the 1st Fusiliers of Oriente were slow to respond and the Sixth's raid was considered a rousing success. During the fighting Garrison would bait the enemy into terrain of his choosing to allow his support lance to pepper the opposing force with indirect fire while performing slow withdrawals toward the other lances in his company. The Hauptmann of the company took to saying the OpFor got 'Garrisoned' and it wasn't long before it stuck as his call sign.

Returning to their post at Starshine, the Sixth was celebrating their victory in one of the larger domed habitats when the Fusiliers got their revenge. Performing a Hover-Drop, a mobile force of Fusiliers attacked, catching the Sixth completely unaware. Scrambling to get back to his 'Mech, Garrison found he was cut off by the Fusiliers' forces. Over the next few days he bided his time until opportunity knocked in he form of a Fusiliers Hunchback 4P that was left in the old Sixth depot area for repairs. Subduing the technicians, Garrison took control of the 'Mech and made to escape the depot. There are many stories about what happened next, but the one thing every story has in common is that the depot was set off, causing a chain reaction that destroyed the Star League era air purifying system that kept the planetary domes habitable. This ultimately led to the world being abandoned of the next few years, another casualty of the Succession Wars.

While the 1st Fusiliers of Oriente made it off world mostly intact, the same could not be said for the Sixth, between their losses during the surprise assault, and the destruction of the depot - the Sixth ceased to be a solvent unit. Garrsioned was one of the few to escape with his life and his new 'Mech. But, even this bit of luck didn't last. While in transit to the Jump Point, the Black Raiders pirates took advantage of the chaos and attempted to capture the DropShip ferrying Garrison and his 'Mech.

While the DropShip was able to escape, Garrison was now without a unit, without a world and without a 'Mech.

Considering his past and knowing that both the world and unit he last served on have passed from existence, many believe Garrison to be jinxed, and considering how he wound up dispossessed and in the hiring halls, maybe there is something to it. But Garrisoned is a skilled Tactician and he has a plan to get back in the game, even if he has had to take his lumps as a merc for nearly a decade.";;"#000000";"#FFFFFF"

The sheer bravado and wildness of the attack threw the Combine Soldiery into disarray, and believing that Lt. Zanos' lance was a spearhead for a larger force they withdrew.  While he had saved these poor souls, what he saw that day caused him to resign his commission and seek ways to help the people.";"Born on New Avalon, the capital world of the Federated Suns, Evan had a complicated history from day one. His father was a noble diplomat from the Lyran Commonwealth and his mother a prominent officer in the New Avalon Crucis March Militia. Their relationship was initially viewed with suspicion by factions within both Houses and life was difficult for Evan as he grew up between worlds. Ironically, years later his family would be lauded as an important step in the improving relations between the two realms. But this would not be in time to make Evan's life any easier.

From a very early age Evan showed an aptitude for VR combat simulation games, often taking units known to be under powered, yet somehow finessing them to victory. This eventually led him to seek a career with the military much to his mother's delight and father's grudging tolerance. He was soon enrolled at the newly formed NAIS, but life there was no picnic, as all his classmates believed him to be there on his parent's accomplishments and not his own merits. Never the less, Evan was determined to prove himself, and would never back down from a challenge.

After graduating, his mother offered to help him gain a position in the March Militia, but Evan continued to want to forge his own destiny. Accepting a junior officer position with the 33rd Avalon Hussars, he left New Avalon behind, yet the spectre of his family continued to follow him.

Always a risk taker, Evan found he much preferred the role of scout, both for the solitude and the opportunities it provided him to show what he could accomplish. Through sheer determination he rose to the rank of Leftenant, but he still wanted a chance to step out from his parent's shadow. Soon he would have his chance in spades.

In 3022 the 33rd was part of an expedition to retake Galtor III from the Draconis Combine, in what became known as one of the bloodiest campaigns in the later part of the 3rd Succession War. During that campaign, Leftenant Zanos' lance was instrumental in scouting out the enemy forces, helping the Federated Suns to eventually retake Galtor.
