She split them among her ships, and Archangel hasn't seen his friends since. He wasn't the most malleable of recruits, but the raider leader had a gift for redirecting his fury and putting his stubborn recklessness to good use.

Eventually, just prior to her retirement, the leader kicked him out of her gang, telling him he'd be better off in a proper mercenary crew with somebody who could both point him in the best direction, and yank his balls out of the fire just in case Plan A failed, failed again, and failed a third time. It turned out she was correct. In the right team, Archangel is amazing.

Markus stole a truck full of hardware, sold it via a friend on the streets, and headed off planet to Solaris VII. There he signed up for an apprenticeship at a stable with openings, went through comprehensive training with other rookies, and survived his first public bout.

He soon realized that he wasn't a fan of people cheering when he lost. As soon as he paid off his training debt, he moved on from Solaris VII to the Periphery, where he now makes a living as a mercenary. He makes friends easily and finally seems content with the life he's made for himself

If sometimes he serves as a pilot, well, at least there's a whole bunch of metal armor between him and the enemies trying to kill him\n\n <b><color=#00ffff>Can Command Tanks and Pilot Mechs.</color></b>";"The son of a Free Worlds League blue collar family with ambitions, Griffin Voyls was an easy-going child who nonetheless always knew his own mind. Although his family encouraged him to enlist or attend a military academy, he chose to go to a technical school because he was pretty sure the discipline of a military enlistment wouldn't suit him.

However, in his last year of school, the military made a serious attempt to recruit him, promising him a position to suit his tastes. He decided to give it a try and accepted a position as a crew member on a military DropShip. Unfortunately, while the discipline and work suited his tastes, DropShip life turned out to be far too close to the front lines for his low-key personality.

He returned to civilian work, doing technical work on industrial 'Mechs. But the war found him again. As he looked at the battlefield his work site had turned into, he realized the only way to manage in the world now was to stay moving, and his preferred way to do that was in a mercenary company. If sometimes he serves as a pilot, well, at least there's a whole bunch of metal armor between him and the enemies trying to kill him

He also began to suspect that he was intentionally abandoned on world by his COs for being of civilian blood. Selling his services as an unlicensed mercenary to the Delacruz yakuza oyabun, and eventually to other private concerns, he quickly gained a reputation for skill in reconnaissance and guerrilla campaigns.

"pilot_Savarok.Description.Details";"Savarok grew up in comfort, with a family that worked hard to pay their way with their Agromech repair and maintenance company.   This comfort bred complacency, contempt and a rebellious attitude, despite having a natural aptitude for piloting he slacked off, bad mouthed his parents to anyone who would listen and ruined potential career opportunities for himself.  This culminated when an ill tempered rant about a prestigious land owner whom was going to give his family enough business for generations was overheard.   The contract was only to be kept if Savarok was removed from the family 'and' the planet.   Within hours he found himself with a rucksack of clothes and a pocket of c-bills aboard a transport to the periphery.  Savarok realised on this trip that an Agromech pilot was going to struggle for work so he lied, begged, and borrowed (sometimes permanently) for any work at every opportunity at every port but this always ended in trouble until he was picked up by a pirate mercenary company as a repair tech.   An opportunity for Savarok arose to pilot the ramshackle pieces of metal the pirates called battlemechs and he grew in confidence quickly - too quickly.  The rebellious nature reared it's ugly head again and after a severe disagreement with the pirate leader he found himself stripped of pirate uniform and heraldry on the wrong side of an airlock door about to be spaced.  Just as the leader was going to press the release button on the outer doors a local government militia ship had snuck up and boarded the pirate ship,  The pirates were all killed and the militia stumbled on him in the airlock.

Savarok now travels between mercenary companies as a mechwarrior looking for good honest work to live.";"Savarok grew up in comfort, with a family that worked hard to pay their way with their Agromech repair and maintenance company. This comfort bred complacency, contempt and a rebellious attitude, despite having a natural aptitude for piloting he slacked off, bad mouthed his parents to anyone who would listen and ruined potential career opportunities for himself. This culminated when an ill tempered rant about a prestigious land owner whom was going to give his family enough business for generations was overheard. The contract was only to be kept if Savarok was removed from the family 'and' the planet. Within hours he found himself with a rucksack of clothes and a pocket of c-bills aboard a transport to the periphery. Savarok realised on this trip that an Agromech pilot was going to struggle for work so he lied, begged, and borrowed (sometimes permanently) for any work at every opportunity at every port but this always ended in trouble until he was picked up by a pirate mercenary company as a repair tech. An opportunity for Savarok arose to pilot the ramshackle pieces of metal the pirates called battlemechs and he grew in confidence quickly - too quickly.
