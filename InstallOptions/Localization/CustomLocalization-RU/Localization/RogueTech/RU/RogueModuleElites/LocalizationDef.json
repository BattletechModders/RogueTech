By the time he was an adult, they were a 'syndicate,' and he was running smuggling operations between cities, escorting the convoys in a BattleMech that had been 'adopted' just like him. Eventually, a long-term investigation fingered him, and the family matriarch shipped him off-planet to Solaris VII, to protect him as well as herself.\r\n\r\nOn Solaris VII, under instructions to create a new identity for himself, he settled into training to join a gladiatorial stable. While there, he dueled and defeated a spunky younger pilot who quickly decided he was her new mentor. When he received word from Bellevue that it was time for him to move on from Solaris VII, the kid followed him all the way out to the Periphery.\r\n\r\nIntermittently, they work together now. When they aren't on the same contracts, he answers her mail. Occasionally. Sometimes.

Zachary chose to obey that final order. Now he wanders the Periphery, putting to use everything he learned at his mentor's side, and hoping to once again find a place where he is valued\n\n<b><color=#00ffff>Может управлять мехами и техникой.</color></b>",

He does not say the name of the company, except to observe, with dark glee, that they no longer exist.\n\nAfter escaping his original company as a young man, he continued to seek employment as a mercenary, first as ground support for BattleMech lances, and then as a BattleMech pilots. He has had many commanders, and does not always leave with good reports. Insubordination is a common complaint. It's not that he's rude. It's just that if he disapproves of a mission, or how it's being carried out, he will instead enact his own plan. But somehow, he stays alive and brings his 'Mech back, which is valuable enough in a pilot\n\n<b><color=#00ffff>Может управлять мехами и техникой.</color></b>",

      "content": "Daksis Rand grew up with information technology as his playground. He was raised on Hachiman in the Draconis Combine, the child of IT executives, and he got an early start dabbling in the digital world. He was a rising star at the technology academy he attended, until certain of his extracurricular activities related to an illegal information brokerage came to light. While nothing was ever proven against him, he left the academy under a cloud of suspicion.\n\nUsing his skills, he managed to hide his dubious record and get a job at Victory Industries, where he worked hard to keep his record clean. If information on a salvage breakthrough leaked, well, there was no evidence it was his fault. Except that record he'd cleaned up came to the attention to the Internal Security Force, who considered that evidence enough.\n\nOnce again, Daksis had to forge a new identity for himself, and this time, he had to burn through quite a few connections just to survive. Once he made it to the Periphery, the pressure eased and he was able to relax a little once again. He decided, for his own health, that he ought to retire from information brokering. So now he's working as a mercenary, because, he says, it keeps him out of worse trouble\n\n<b><color=#00ffff>Может управлять мехами и техникой.</color></b>",

He managed to develop a completely normal personality, with good metrics in every field that mattered and his parents are still patting themselves on the back about that twenty years later.\n\nHe went to a military academy on Coromodir 6, and after graduation pursued further schooling before joining the Royal Guard. There, he quickly became a popular lieutenant due to his mild personality, dependable nature and general patience. Unfortunately, in 3022, a new commanding officer made the mistake of assuming all those positive traits meant he would blindly obey illegal orders.\n\nAfter incapacitating his commanding officer, he directed his command in the defense of House Arano until it was clear there was no immediate hope in that regard. He then saw to his command's safety before escaping off-world. Now, he works as a mercenary while monitoring the Aurigan situation, waiting for a chance to once again honor his oaths to House Arano\n\n<b><color=#00ffff>Может управлять мехами и техникой.</color></b>",

      "content": "Born and raised on Mechdur, Anja Bray was orphaned early in a vehicle accident. She spent part of her childhood in a group home before being fostered with a family of small business owners and philanthropists. They saw that she received a good education, and after, that she had a place in their enterprise.\n\nUnfortunately, although she tried very hard to impress her benefactors, she was incurably honest. Not just honest, but <i>truthful</i>, in a way that embarrassed even customers of the business. Her family-turned-employers took her off the sales floor. <i>Nobody</i> wanted her on the admin level, so they sent her back to school for an advanced degree.
