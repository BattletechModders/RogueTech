Because of his wealthy background, James was easily able to enter the Somerset Military Academy, where he scored in the top 15% of his class and won a coveted position in a Cadet Trade with House Davion's Albion Military Academy.\r\n\r\nAfter graduation, he earned his callsign 'Arbiter' evaluating recently dispossessed MechWarriors to see if they were worthy of a replacement machine. This was just a stepping stone to getting his own BattleMech, however. He earned assignment to a Griffin after several years writing up reports on other pilots and attending off-hours training sessions.  He was assigned to the Storm Company in the Lyran Guard, where he served faithfully for a five year tour.\r\n\r\nHowever, when he was overlooked for a promotion due to his lack of family connections, he realized he had no interest in spending the rest of his life as nothing more than a 'Mech pilot for the military.

      "content": "Diana Lunari, of the Outworld Alliance, grew up in the shadow of the Praxton fusion engine factories where her single mother scraped out a living. In primary school, she learned a number of safety routines, but the only ones that really mattered were the Fusion Accident drill and the Raiders drill. In her teens, she spent time developing an improved drill so that kids would have a better chance of surviving either eventuality, but nobody wanted to change what hadn't yet failed and all she accomplished was losing her chance at a scholarship. So, as soon as she could she enlisted.\r\n\r\nIn the Alliance Grenadiers, she kept her head down for a while, pushing herself to be the toughest of the tough while learning all the protocols of her regiment. After a few years she once again felt like she'd identified some easily repairable flaws in the military machine, and cautiously, to a trusted superior, she made some suggestions. Once again, her suggestions were rejected, but this time she was transferred to the unnumbered 'shadow battalion' of the Grenadiers, where her superior promised her analysis skills would be appreciated. They were.

It's even his explanation for how, once he settled at Solaris Vii and built up his own stable, he threw it all away to become a mercenary in the Periphery.\r\n\r\nSiegfried Krauss doesn't deal with breakups very well at all. But he can't seem to help falling in love. And, of course, who can resist falling in love with him? If only they'd <i>stay</i> in love. If only all sparkling-eyed brunettes would just… stay away. If only, once the relationship ended, he could stand to stay where once he'd had so many happy memories. But he can't. It simply hurts too much\n\n",

He was one of the first graduates from the newly rebuilt Robinson Battle Academy, and was assigned a position of responsibility early.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, despite his lineage, his training and his confidence, he lacked the wisdom to lead his command well.

Hard work was valuable, but not to the elite.\r\n\r\nIn retaliation, he anonymously drew caricatures of many of the figures associated with the school that had rejected him, and the local net went wild over them. When offended nobles started sending investigators to find out who had mocked them, Duncan quickly enlisted, reasoning correctly that it was the best place to hide in plain sight.\r\n\r\nIn basic training, nobody cared about his cartoons as long as he did as ordered. They cared even less when he volunteered for anti-'Mech and insurgency training. Once again, he was in a place where hard work mattered, and soon he was assigned to SAFE, the Free Worlds League intelligence arm. They found his artistic skills and the keen perception that went with them quite useful. He did not, of course, make a name for himself, because his work was never signed, but even after he was injured and transferred back home again, some of his cartoons were used as an unofficial currency among the members of the Analysis Branch.\r\n\r\nHe remained on his home planet until it was attacked and annexed by the Capellan Confederation. After escaping the invasion with his family and seeing them resettled elsewhere in the Duchy, he made his way to Galatea to earn a living as a mercenary. He still draws his cartoons, still never signs them, but the junior pilots and crew who receive one after a blunder know exactly who they come from and, if they're smart, they treasure them\n\n",

He grew up learning almost all of the trades associated with spacefaring merchants, but was far better working with his hands than bartering with customers.\r\n\r\nFor many years, he felt he had nothing to complain of as one of the younger members of a very large family. However, as the oldest generation began passing away, Risenki found himself being drawn into the more complicated squabbles of the new generation of leaders.

He even attended the Robinson Battle Academy, where his loyalty to House Davion was complemented by indoctrination with the hatred for the Draconis Combine so common in Robinson graduates. But he was never able to graduate from Robinson Battle Academy. During a live fire examination conducted though a punitive raid on Delacruz, Michael was deep behind enemy lines on a reconnaissance mission when recall orders came in from central command. So far from the landing zone and unable to arrive safely before liftoff, he was abandoned and left for dead. Fleeing deep into the forested wilderness, he left his assigned mech, a battered old SDR-5V Spider, under a makeshift shelter. He adopted a local name to help to hide his identity, and masqueraded as a member of the unproductive class until he could secure transport off-world. \r\n\r\nAt first, he expected all the horror stories fed to him about the Combine to be the truth, but quickly learned that not only had much of what he'd been taught had been a gross vilification, but numerous atrocities that pushed the boundaries of the Ares Conventions that his own forces had committed were never spoken of. He also began to suspect that he was intentionally abandoned on world by his COs for being of civilian blood. Selling his services as an unlicensed mercenary to the Delacruz yakuza oyabun, and eventually to other private concerns, he quickly gained a reputation for skill in reconnaissance and guerrilla campaigns. Now, though he has moved far beyond the combine-suns border, he hopes to one day strike back at his former COs who left him for dead\n\n",

За любовь к блестящим вещам Наташа получила прозвище Сорока («Мэгпай»), и ей удаётся вести роскошную жизнь, даже находясь в бегах. Очевидно, её старая сеть развалилась, когда она «потеряла» несколько посылок. С тех пор она бегает от своих кредиторов. Очевидно, если мы возьмем её на борт, она свяжет нас с тайником с припасами где-то в системе. Более того, она утверждает, что является квалифицированным механиком и имеет лицензию на вождение различных наземных видов техники. Может быть, мы могли бы использовать её в качестве пилота танка? Примечание старпома: Босс, надеюсь, вы знаете, что делаете, пуская Сороку на корабль. Если кто-нибудь узнает о её присутствии на корабле до того, как мы уйдем, у нас могут возникнуть проблемы.",

Some nights after repairing the 'Mechs, he would sneak back in. He spent these nights learning the complicated controls inside each 'Mech. That is until he was discovered one night and fired. No charges were pressed, but the head mechanic couldn't afford to keep him on any longer.",

This comfort bred complacency, contempt and a rebellious attitude, despite having a natural aptitude for piloting he slacked off, bad mouthed his parents to anyone who would listen and ruined potential career opportunities for himself.  This culminated when an ill tempered rant about a prestigious land owner whom was going to give his family enough business for generations was overheard.   The contract was only to be kept if Savarok was removed from the family 'and' the planet.   Within hours he found himself with a rucksack of clothes and a pocket of c-bills aboard a transport to the periphery.  Savarok realised on this trip that an Agromech pilot was going to struggle for work so he lied, begged, and borrowed (sometimes permanently) for any work at every opportunity at every port but this always ended in trouble until he was picked up by a pirate mercenary company as a repair tech.   An opportunity for Savarok arose to pilot the ramshackle pieces of metal the pirates called battlemechs and he grew in confidence quickly - too quickly.  The rebellious nature reared it's ugly head again and after a severe disagreement with the pirate leader he found himself stripped of pirate uniform and heraldry on the wrong side of an airlock door about to be spaced.  Just as the leader was going to press the release button on the outer doors a local government militia ship had snuck up and boarded the pirate ship,  The pirates were all killed and the militia stumbled on him in the airlock.   With some quick thinking he was able to convince the miltia he was not affiliated with the pirates and he was spared.   This was the defining moment for him as he now realised he had a second opportunity to live and vowed to not let any of the bad habits of his past continue.   Savarok now travels between mercenary companies as a mechwarrior looking for good honest work to live.",

When Davion invaded her homeworld, the 23 year old Alicia found herself pushed into the frontline as a member of a resistance cell defying the Federated Suns occupation of the world. Here Alicia found herself rising though the ranks until she was the leader of the most active cell on the world. While estimates vary, most historians place her activities as claiming 1500 - 2900 lives of Davion occupation forces.\n\nAfter a particular gruesome attack on a Davion regional headquarters, FedSuns troops had had enough and began retaliatory strikes against the population. Fearing for the lives of her loved ones, Alicia used her contacts in the Maskirovka to arrange them to be smuggled off world so that she could continue her campaign against the FedSuns occupiers. Unfortunately for Alicia, one of the citizens killed by the Davion retaliation was a distant relative of the Chancellor himself. As such the Maskirovka decided to avenge the Chancellor and to deal with a citizen they viewed as becoming too popular and so they betrayed Alicia, shooting down the dropship carrying everyone Alicia had ever truly cared for and selling out the location of her cell's headquarters to a local Davion commander.\n\nDavion jumped at the chance to deal with this thorn in their side once and for all and mercilessly bombed the entire village that housed her headquarters. Badly wounded, Alicia somehow survived the attack, dragging her ruined body several miles before collapsing near a remote and secret Comstar listening post. Found by a patrol, Alicia was smuggled off world, with the local Comstar Demi-Precentor seeing her potential as an operative for them. Despite the scars now covering her body, Alicia would fully recover thanks to cybernetic implants that were surgically embedded in her.\n\nFilled with hatred for all the successor lords, it was of little surprise that Alicia, now going by the code name \"Lady Alekto\", sided with the Word of Blake when the schism within Comstar occured. When the Jihad broke out, Alekto soon made a terrifying name for herself. Unafraid to order even the largest scale war-crimes imaginable, Alekto brilliantly masterminded numerous devastating strikes against the successor lords over the years of the brutal war. In addition it was found that she had a knack for designing battlemech loadouts, that while appearing odd, turned out to be highly effective and virtual nightmares to face.

      "original": "Carl \"Cargo Vroom\" Vranich was born on Alpheratz in the Outworlds Alliance and is often regarded as one of the most prolific vehicle designers to have ever lived. \n\nGrowing up in a rather spartan household typical of the periphery, Cargo opted out of school from an early age with necessity forcing him to work as soon as he was able to help support his family. Initially Cargo learned the family trade as a run of the mill vehicle mechanic, however it became quickly that Cargo was meant for more as he showed a knack for not just fixing vehicles, but improving upon them.\n\nBy his 21st birthday, Cargo found himself drafted into the Alliance Borderers as a tank mechanic. Here Cargo quickly rose through the ranks of the unit's engineering corps, proving not only hard working but able to diagnose and and fix issues that even mechanics with 30 years more experience with those models could not. \n\nBy his 25th birthday, Cargo found himself the head mechanic on a detachment of the Borderers stationed on Cerberus when fate struck in the form of a deep raid by DCMS troops. As Kuritan forces struck the base Cargo was stationed at, they scattered the battalion defenders and began tearing through the hangers destroying vehicle after vehicle. Provoked into rage by watching days of his hard work going up into smoke, it is said Cargo grabbed the nearest few fellow mechanics by their shirts and shoved them in the closest tank to them. Taking the lead, Cargo then proceeded to lead the completely green crew in fierce defensive action. Cargo and his makeshift crew not only held out while crucial reinforcements arrived, but also succeeded in crippling 2 mechs and outright destroying one. For his quick thinking and heroic efforts, Cargo was awarded some of the nation's most prestigious military service awards. When offered monetary awards Cargo turned them down, instead requesting that he be allowed to bring his beloved pet ferret with him to work, a request a rather stunned high command accepted.\n\nFor the next decade Cargo served in the duel roles as both the head mechanic of the Borderers and as a tank commander in its command company before largely retiring from front-line service. This was at the behest of the Alliance high command, who had come to value his ever increasing skill at designing vehicle variants that were both cheap to produce and extremely cost effective.\n\nNow heading a design bureau, Cargo has become one of these most despised people alive to many mechwarriors. So terrifying are the designs he has produced that many a mechwarrior has called them \"bullshit\" or decried that mechs are supposed to be the kings of the battlefield, not tanks. Perhaps it is not surprising then that when Cargo makes trips to the field for studies, he does so primarily amongst other tank crews.\n",

The goal of the project was the creation of a next generation AI. While slow going, the project incorporated a number of unique innovations. Built on a modular and flexible design, in contrast to its predecessor the new AI proved to much more capable than the original. After several more years of development the new AI, now dubbed RogueBot II was deemed ready to enter service with the Star League.\n\nRogueBot II's initial deployment was not as smooth as many had hoped, but it none the less quickly took over the original RogueBot's responsibilities within the Star League and the original was slated for decommissioning. RogueBot II's more modular design allowed for continuous improvements to be made to the AI at a relatively rapid rate and it found itself pressed into an ever growing number of roles within the government, primarily as a cost saving measure.\n\nLike with the original RogueBot, the SLDF attempted to press the AI into military service, seeing drone combatants as the future. After some work the AI proved a quick study with ground combat forces and the army began reaching out to contractors to help design new battlemechs and ground vehicles for mass deployment as drones. Naval combat proved trickier but slow progress was being made.\n\nUltimately, these plans were put to an end with the Amaris coupe. While Amaris attempted to co-opt RogueBot, he found he was unable and the AI swiftly relocated its core servers to an unknown location and remained a persistant thorn in the usurper's side for the duration of his rule.\n\nAfter the war finished, RogueBot evidently decided that the Star League was dead and refused all efforts to be brought back under the control of the Star League or any of its member states. Every now and again some of the rare or prototype drone units the AI once commanded have been spotted raiding or defending various places throughout the Inner-Sphere or periphery. What the purpose of these deployments is remains unknown, although it seems the AI has remained in occasional contact with the clans over the centuries, even as the successor lords remained unaware of their existence, notably having a strange relationship with the Star Adder Khan, Bearing. Some strange rumors even persist linking the fabled \"Mr. Bubbles\" to the rogue AI, with more than a few hinting it as having become her pet.\n",

      "content": "As the Star League reached its pinnacle of its technological advancements, it became apparent that the artificial intelligence entrusted to help run the bloated bureaucracy was being outclassed and showing its age.\n\nAfter a number of attempted upgrades failed to improve RogueBot, the Star League initiated project Echo. The goal of the project was the creation of a next generation AI. While slow going, the project incorporated a number of unique innovations. Built on a modular and flexible design, in contrast to its predecessor the new AI proved to much more capable than the original. After several more years of development the new AI, now dubbed RogueBot II was deemed ready to enter service with the Star League.\n\nRogueBot II's initial deployment was not as smooth as many had hoped, but it none the less quickly took over the original RogueBot's responsibilities within the Star League and the original was slated for decommissioning. RogueBot II's more modular design allowed for continuous improvements to be made to the AI at a relatively rapid rate and it found itself pressed into an ever growing number of roles within the government, primarily as a cost saving measure.\n\nLike with the original RogueBot, the SLDF attempted to press the AI into military service, seeing drone combatants as the future. After some work the AI proved a quick study with ground combat forces and the army began reaching out to contractors to help design new battlemechs and ground vehicles for mass deployment as drones. Naval combat proved trickier but slow progress was being made.\n\nUltimately, these plans were put to an end with the Amaris coupe. While Amaris attempted to co-opt RogueBot, he found he was unable and the AI swiftly relocated its core servers to an unknown location and remained a persistant thorn in the usurper's side for the duration of his rule.\n\nAfter the war finished, RogueBot evidently decided that the Star League was dead and refused all efforts to be brought back under the control of the Star League or any of its member states. Every now and again some of the rare or prototype drone units the AI once commanded have been spotted raiding or defending various places throughout the Inner-Sphere or periphery. What the purpose of these deployments is remains unknown, although it seems the AI has remained in occasional contact with the clans over the centuries, even as the successor lords remained unaware of their existence, notably having a strange relationship with the Star Adder Khan, Bearing. Some strange rumors even persist linking the fabled \"Mr. Bubbles\" to the rogue AI, with more than a few hinting it as having become her pet.\n",

To do what the Federated Suns asked him to do.\r\n\r\nSo he did, for a while. He tracked and brokered and assassinated. Until Mama died anyhow, at the bottom of an endless waiting list for another surgery. He walked away that night, collected his two youngest sisters and his orphaned nieces, and took them all out to the Periphery, away from the corrupt, treacherous Inner Sphere. Now, they live someplace safe. He still sends them most of the money he makes as a mercenary, and his kit is covered in photos of his family. The older ones are somber, but the younger ones smile.

      "content": "\"Merchant of Death,\" \"Reaper of Detroit,\" \"Traitor\" & \"just a typical Capellan.\" These are all titles that have been used to describe the figure known as \"Ruin,\" \"Rapture\" & \"Teatime.\" Little concrete information is available about this figure. Even the secret records of the Capellan Confederation offer precious few details other than recording that he is a Capellan citizen.\n\nA deeper dive into some unofficial channels seem to indicate that Teatime was a Maskirovka agent once tasked with advising the Chancellor himself. At some point during this assignment, it seems that Teatime went rogue and used his influence to betray several allies of the Confederation.\n\nRevealed as the root of the betrayal, Teatime was forced to flee, taking on several aliases. Over the course of the next several years, Teatime kept busy by plying the trade routes of Capellan and Canopian space under the guise of a weapons merchant. However, it was eventually found that much of his merchandise was stolen from the Magistracy of Canopus’ own stockpiles and those of the neighbouring Andurien state.\n\nNow hunted by three governments and their agents, Teatime fled to the world of Detroit. On Detroit, forces from all three nations converged to capture the man. However, thanks to years of training, Teatime not only eluded his would be capturers, but turned them against one another. As the three forces battled for who would capture the rogue agent, Teatime unleashed a store of chemical weapons on the planet, decimating its population, along with his hunters. \n\nFollowing the Detroit massacre, Teatime disappeared for several more years, eventually surfacing once more, this time at the head of a mercenary band under the employ of the Society during their invasion of the Inner Sphere using the subverted MRBC.\n\nFinally Teatime disappeared altogether, with no confirmed sightings since. Mysteriously, the Capellan records of his crimes and most other documents regarding him vanished at roughly the same time. \n\nSome unconfirmed theories resound that state that teatime did not actually betray the Confederation at all. Instead they hypothesize he remains a Maskirovka agent, playing out a long and subtle operation. What the aim of this operation is varies from one theory to another, but if any are true, then every citizen in the Sphere should fear what one of the most dangerous Maskirovka agents has in store.",

Post-battle salvage teams noted that while the majority of Burt's 'Mech had suffered catastrophic damage, the cockpit was relatively intact, albeit empty.

      "original": "Casparamaris represents perhaps one of the most bizarre chapters of history within the Inner-Sphere's long and storied annals. As with many things concerning Amaris and the fall of the Star-League, records concerning the origin of this rather unique drone are fragmented, incomplete and unlikely to ever be fully uncovered.\n\nWhat records do exist point to a break through in artificial intelligence just prior to Amaris' coup d’état.This break through would have allowed AI to be created with what was dubbed a 'personality' matrix that would have allowed the AI to emulate the individual the matrix was based on to a near indistinguishable degree. With these matrices were too large to be mounted on anything smaller than a capital warship, the SLDF envisioned the creation of specialty drone warships based on their most skilled naval commanders to command fleets of drone warships. This would have all but ensuring the SLDF's continued naval dominance.\n\nAfter the Amaris Coup, it seems that research and development on the system continued, and records make clear that at least one functional prototype based on the infamous M5 Caspar drone was created. Paranoid and self-absorbed to the extreme, it is perhaps not surprising that Amaris would see no personality more suitable for testing these new warships than his own. Thus was Casparamaris born.\n\nNo records in the Inner-Sphere tell of any actions or the fate of this 'Casparamaris' but it would seem that the unit survived not only the downfall of the Amaris Empire, but also the maelstrom of the early succession wars. With no recorded actions during these years, where Casparamaris was and what it was doing remain unanswered. What is known is that the drone warship made itself known to the house lords around the year 3047 when it appeared high in orbit around Harrow's Sun, annihilating a stunned Draconis Combine garrison in the name of the Federated Suns. After this Casparamaris would make regular appearances in systems under invasion offering its services to the highest bidder. Despite being a warship, with fully functional capital-scale weapons, Casparamaris would instead drop battlemechs onto the field equipped with some form of remote drone control, a technology that the Word of Blake would use to dramatic effect a few decades later, perhaps indicating this technology was far older than previously thought.\n\nBecoming a famed mercenary unit, it also became increasing clear that Casparamaris was searching for something, but what that something was remains unknown even to this day. What is known is that the unit's now ancient personality matrix was either starting to decay or the personality was becoming ever-more like the real Amaris, becoming somewhat obsessed with bibs and making near constant orders at the Golden Corral despite not requiring food.\n\nAfter turning hostile to everyone, elements of Comstar and various mercenary groups had enough and banded together and attacked the rogue drone, eventually crippling it. In a desperate attempt to escape the drone attempted to execute a blind jump, resulting in a spectacular explosion. This was the last time Casparamaris was spotted, yet in the aftermath of the explosion there was not enough debris to conclusively confirm the destruction of the drone. While most analysts in Comstar state the rogue warship was destroyed pointing to the huge drop in unconfirmed sightings and destruction of supply convoys, others point to the fact that Casparamaris once went over two hundred years without being sighted or known about suggesting the AI may once again have changed how it was operating.\n\nNaturally, there are many questions surrounding Casparamaris, Where was the drone warship for over 200 years between end of the Star-League and what was it doing? What caused the drone to suddenly return? Why did it turn on everyone? What was it searching for? was it acting alone or was it under control of a yet unknown actor? What was it doing with all the bibs and food it recieved from the Golden Corral?\n\nSome believe that the answers to at least some of these questions might be found in the secret archives of Aleksandr Kerensky and his son Nicholas, but Clan Wolf outright refuses to even confirm if such documents are in their possession, let alone the contents to any such material. If any such documents do exist, perhaps they hold the answer to the most burning questions, was there more a single prototype constructed? and if so, how many others are out there, still functioning?\n",

Earning the respect of his peers, Han was a natural choice for the Khanship of the clan when Khan Leo Koga died in a trial defending the Coyotes' honour amongst the other clans in the wake of the Society invasion.\n\nUnder Han's rule, the Coyotes were able to regain much of their lost standing in the eyes of their peers, though this came at the cost of becoming bitter enemies with Clan Blood Spirit. Seeing the Spirit's ever shifting demands, Han lead a coalition of the remaining homeworld clans to expel the Blood Spirits, exiling them to Colleen and the invasion corridor.\n\nAfter a war to keep the Magistracy of Canopus out of the K-Cluster, Han decided that the homeworld clans must once more invade the Inner Sphere, as it was clear that there was no way to prevent the taint of the Inner Sphere away from their homes without its conquest.\n\nLeading the Coyotes, Stone Lions, Star Adders & Cloud Cobras towards the Sphere, they were rebuffed by the juggernaut that was Clan Ghost Bear and it was made clear that they would not allow the homeworld clans to pass through their space. This forced the Coyotes to retreat for a time, but undeterred, Han decided that they would instead travel through the invasion corridor and avoid Ghost Bear space.\n\nThis unfortunately would mean pushing through the exiled Blood Spirits, and so Han started an invasion of their space. For the next three years, the Coyotes and Blood Spirits fought to a near standstill and neither were able to make significant passage through the corridor. During this time, Han earned his lasting callsign of 'Iron Khan' for his determination to reach the sphere. Eventually both clans came to grudgingly respect one another and slowly they began to co-operate to reach the sphere. Eventually Han reached the space of the Hanseatic League only to discover that they had arrived too late and were now blockaded from entering the near periphery once more by the Ghost Bears.\n\nThe Coyotes and Ghost Bears fought a brief war in the stars between the League and the Chainelane Isles, but ultimately the Coyotes were not able to match the Bears and all seemed lost for Han's quest.\n\nHowever, it soon turned out that the Society was not as defeated as once thought and it was revealed they had infiltrated the MRBC. As the Society's chaos swept through the Sphere, the Coyotes slipped into Davion space,  eventually settling a sector of periphery space near the Taurian Concordat. Relations between the clan and House Davion quickly soured and the Coyotes found themselves soon in battle against the Federated Suns.\n\nAround this time, the Primus of ComStar and the Aurgian Coalition offered the Coyotes a chance to join the so-called 'New Star-League'. With little to lose, Han chose to align himself with this new alliance and by war's end several years later, the Coyotes found themselves to be one of major clan's operating within the Sphere, second to only the irksome Ghost Bears.\n\nThough the 'New Star-League' fell apart in the years after the war, the Coyotes were well positioned to dominate the area against their former allies, while a burgeoning alliance formed between Han and his former enemies in Clan Blood Spirit. \n\nNever destined to become the ilKhan of the Clans, Han nonetheless represented the rebirth of his Clan and for decades to come, his influence was felt in the Kerensky Cluster as the Coyotes dominated it once more.\n",

As Trex reached her senior years, she passed the reigns of leadership to her daughter, now a very experienced figure in her own right and in her prime.\n\nUnfortunately for Juli, her reign would quickly turn from a golden age into one of conflict and devastation as a new cycle of war rippled through the Inner Sphere and Periphery. Before her reign was more than three years old, the Taurian Concordat swiftly and brutally invaded the Reach. With the aid of elite mercenary units, the Coalition forces were routed time and time again, and in short order Julimarie was forced into hiding with what remained of the nation's military.\n\nFor the next 4 years, Julimarie worked in secret, evading Taurian patrols and preparing for a guerrilla-style campaign to reclaim her beloved nation. Eventually, having gathered her strength, Julimarie launched herself into the fray into a quest to reclaim her nation, just like her grandmother before her. \n\nTaking the Taurians by relative surprise, Julimarie was able to rapidly re-secure most of the worlds of the Coalition in fairly short order, capturing huge amounts of Taurian war materiel in the process. Seeking to punish the Taurians for their betrayal, Julimarie ordered the annexation of several Taurian worlds before the Taurians sued for peace.\n\nThe next several years were relatively peaceful for the fragile nation, but Julimarie continued her military build-up, determined to break the cycle of war that had repeatedly torn her nation apart. When given the chance to join the so-called new 'Star League', Julimarie jumped at the chance and allied herself to ComStar and the recently arrived Clan Coyote. Launching an assault on the Federated Suns, the Aurigans were met with great success and eventually doubled their size by absorbing some key Davion worlds before the flames of war were slowly put out across the Sphere.\n\nFor the rest of her reign, peace was maintained and the nation prospered in ways a Periphery nation could rarely dream of, thanks to the advanced technologies they were able to access from their allies. However, the military might of the nation was drained, with little chance of a quick re-build as neither ComStar nor the Coyotes would provide advanced military hardware.\n\nTowards the end of her reign, the friction of dealing with the alien culture of Clan society began to rise ever-higher and Julimarie began to wonder if allowing the Coyotes into the Rimward-Periphery was a mistake or not. Leaving the throne to her daughter, Julimarie watched the so-called 'Star League' alliance collapse in her final years, just like all previous leagues.

      "original": "Quizel Narf has been described as either one of the greatest or one of the worst pirate lords to have ever graced the history books.\n\nBorn on a back water world of the Circinus Federation, Narf grew up hearing stories of daring raids, fortunes won and lost and buried treasure. Enthralled by these tales, even if most weren't true, Narf quickly decided the pirates life was for him and at the young age of 17 joined his first pirate crew.\n\nThere Narf stood above his peers, proving to be both cunning, fearless and a natural at finding hidden \"booty\". These qualities soon found Narf rising through the ranks of command until at the age of 26, when the entire crew he was serving under was wiped out in a Lyran sting operation. \n\nBarely escaping himself, Narf decided to start his own crew instead of joining someone elses. It was here that Narf's true talent was discovered: his ability to recruit people to his cause. Such was his talent that before his 30th birthday, Narf found himself a pirate lord, having recruited enough people to create and run no less than a dozen different crews all under his command.\n\nDespite his disdain for politics, Narf's power meant he was a household name within the loosely governed federation and he soon found himself a central figure of it. It is here that the federation's craze with racoons is said to have come from as Narf was so fond of the terran raccoon that he underwent numerous surgeries in the nearby Magistracy of Canopus until he outwardly looked like one.\n\nUpon learning of the clan invasion of the Inner-Sphere, Narf fantasized of leading the federation to become a clan, less out of a desire to be recognized as a member of a warrior-people and more because he thought it would be funny and annoy other clans to no end. A mere 5 years later, taking full advantage of the Word of Blake's jihad, Narf and his crews manged to pull off one of the greatest feats any pirate ever has, not only landing on, but sacking Strana Mechty itself. While clan reinforcements forced the pirates off world within hours and years later altered their histories to state the sacking never happened, it did not stop Narf from proclaiming himself khan of a new clan known as \"Skull-Squid\". While no clan would ever recognize the claim (in fact, some they actively attempted to kill the now infamous pirate lord) it did not stop Narf or his crews from using the term whenever possible.\n\nThat is not to say all of Narf's plans went off without a hitch, and one of his greatest failures came with his alliance to Hans O'Reilly and his attempt to help place him on the throne of the Marian Hegemony.

      "prevOriginal": "Quizel Narf has been described as either one of the greatest or one of the worst pirate lords to have ever graced the history books.\n\nBorn on a back water world of the Circinus Federation, Narf grew up hearing stories of daring raids, fortunes won and lost and buried treasure. Enthralled by these tales, even if most weren't true, Narf quickly decided the pirates life was for him and at the young age of 17 joined his first pirate crew.\n\nThere Narf stood above his peers, proving to be both cunning, fearless and a natural at finding hidden \"booty\". These qualities soon found Narf rising through the ranks of command until at the age of 26, when the entire crew he was serving under was wiped out in a Lyran sting operation. \n\nBarely escaping himself, Narf decided to start his own crew instead of joining someone elses. It was here that Narf's true talent was discovered: his ability to recruit people to his cause. Such was his talent that before his 30th birthday, Narf found himself a pirate lord, having recruited enough people to create and run no less than a dozen different crews all under his command.\n\nDespite his disdain for politics, Narf's power meant he was a household name within the loosely governed federation and he soon found himself a central figure of it. It is here that the federation's craze with racoons is said to have come from as Narf was so fond of the terran raccoon that he underwent numerous surgeries in the nearby Magistracy of Canopus until he outwardly looked like one.\n\nUpon learning of the clan invasion of the Inner-Sphere, Narf fantasized of leading the federation to become a clan, less out of a desire to be recognized as a member of a warrior-people and more because he thought it would be funny and annoy other clans to no end. A mere 5 years later, taking full advantage of the Word of Blake's jihad, Narf and his crews manged to pull off one of the greatest feats any pirate ever has, not only landing on, but sacking Strana Mechty itself. While clan reinforcements forced the pirates off world within hours and years later altered their histories to state the sacking never happened, it did not stop Narf from proclaiming himself khan of a new clan known as \"Skull-Squid\". While no clan would ever recognize the claim (in fact, some they actively attempted to kill the now infamous pirate lord) it did not stop Narf or his crews from using the term whenever possible.\n\nThat is not to say all of Narf's plans went off without a hitch, and one of his greatest failures came with his alliance to Hans O'Reilly and his attempt to help place him on the throne of the Marian Hegemony.

While talented enough to earn himself a spot within the Clan's touman as a tanker, he was never destined to journey with the Clan's trueborn warriors on their conquest of the Inner Sphere.\n\nFortunately for Rime, this meant he was spared from Clan Hell's Horses' exile from their homeworlds following the War of Reaving. With the Horses now abjured, Rime was part of the homeworld remnants of the Clan that was re-organized into the newly formed Clan Stone Lion.\n\nWhile most derided the new Clan as a pawn of the Star Adders, Rime was determined to change this notion.

What passes for news from this agency comes in the form of random nonsense and misinformation, however, it seems that perhaps there is some truth behind at least some of these words as Slippy has found himself to be relentlessy hunted by INN 'Fact-Checker' teams with orders to take down the insane Director.",

      "original": "A member of the so-called 'Ghosts of Skye', or more colloquially known as the 'Rangers', little background information is available on the mysterious Tobias Rieper.\n\nFrom his own public statements, Tobias was born on the world of Skye, as apparently all members of the ghosts are. Orphaned at an early age, Tobias became a ward of the state, having no living relatives after a rare chemical attack on the world during the closing days of the Fourth Succession War. Too young to remember his family, Tobias was adopted by members of the order and trained from a young age in the ways of warfare.\n\nUpon coming to the age of majority, Tobias was enrolled into the LCAF, and by the powers that be, was assigned to the elite 4th Skye Rangers, which according to Tobias all members of the Ghosts serve in for at least some period of time. Here Tobias distinguished himself, eventually even coming to the attention of the FedCom Archon-Prince after saving the Archon-Prince's life from a would-be assassin. Grateful to the young mechwarrior, the Archon gifted Tobias with a unique variant of the time-tested Orion mech, equipped with the very best tech available to the state.\n\nTobias used this mech to great effect, and although he left the LCAF shortly before the outbreak of the Clan invasion, Tobias would fight along side his old unit and his fellow ghosts during the Clan Invasion and himself participated in Operation Serpent.\n\nFollowing the end of the Clan-created crisis, Tobias disappeared from the public, but was later known to have been active during the FedCom Civil war and the Blakist Jihad that followed. \n\nAs war once again engulfed the sphere following Comstar's invasion of the nascent Republic of the Sphere, the Ghosts decided to make themselves known again, this time as mercenaries for hire. Although Tobias was chosen to be their public point of contact, he was clear that he was not their leader, rather he had been forced into the role as the result of a lost bet with someone known as 'Byrd'. From here, Tobias could be found on several fronts of the war, aiding the Taurians conquests of the Calderon Protectorate and Aurigan Coalition. After these conquests, the Rangers proceeded to smash Comstar's lines under the direction of house Davion, largely changing the course of that conflict.\n\nAfter these high profile contracts, Tobias vanished for sometime, but was spotted aiding the society during their so-called 'Society Summer' invasion. Finally, under the direction of the mysterious council that runs the Ghosts, Tobias and several regiments of Rangers were sent coreward on a mission to claim ownership of clan Cloud Cobra. Here it was revealed that Tobias was a descendant of the Riaz family and under clan laws had possible claims to the Riaz bloodname. After winning the right to bloodname, Tobias engaged the khan of the Cobras in a trial of position, a trial he won with relative ease and in so doing became khan of the clan.\n\nWhile most clanners were not happy with this, they had little choice to obey as Tobias stirred the Cobras into an invasion of the Ghost Bear Dominion. After a protracted Trial of Possession for 59 worlds of the Bears, the Cobras under Tobias emerged victorious with the aid of the ghost regiments now integrated into the clan. From there, under orders, Tobias proceeded to invade his homeworld of Skye, taking the world under command of the council.\n\nThen Tobias was issued one final set of orders, which he executed in the closing days of the war. Taking advantage of their momentum against the republic, Tobias laid siege to and successfully claimed Terra, becoming ilKhan in the process and making Cloud Cobra the ilClan. At the same time, Cobra forces executed a daring attack on the clan homeworld of Strana Mechty, claiming it for themselves.\n\nFor the next several decades Tobias ruled over the Cloud Cobras and eventually returned the world of Skye to Lyran control, evidently the council's overall goal for the entire operation. Some fifty years later, at the age of 92 Tobias finally passed away, becoming the oldest living Khan ever, and the only one for the Cobra's to pass away due to old age, having successfully fended off dozens of challenges for the position over that time span.",

Orphaned at an early age, Tobias became a ward of the state, having no living relatives after a rare chemical attack on the world during the closing days of the Fourth Succession War. Too young to remember his family, Tobias was adopted by members of the order and trained from a young age in the ways of warfare.\n\nUpon coming to the age of majority, Tobias was enrolled into the LCAF, and by the powers that be, was assigned to the elite 4th Skye Rangers, which according to Tobias all members of the Ghosts serve in for at least some period of time. Here Tobias distinguished himself, eventually even coming to the attention of the FedCom Archon-Prince after saving the Archon-Prince's life from a would-be assassin. Grateful to the young mechwarrior, the Archon gifted Tobias with a unique variant of the time-tested Orion mech, equipped with the very best tech available to the state.\n\nTobias used this mech to great effect, and although he left the LCAF shortly before the outbreak of the Clan invasion, Tobias would fight along side his old unit and his fellow ghosts during the Clan Invasion and himself participated in Operation Serpent.\n\nFollowing the end of the Clan-created crisis, Tobias disappeared from the public, but was later known to have been active during the FedCom Civil war and the Blakist Jihad that followed. \n\nAs war once again engulfed the sphere following Comstar's invasion of the nascent Republic of the Sphere, the Ghosts decided to make themselves known again, this time as mercenaries for hire. Although Tobias was chosen to be their public point of contact, he was clear that he was not their leader, rather he had been forced into the role as the result of a lost bet with someone known as 'Byrd'. From here, Tobias could be found on several fronts of the war, aiding the Taurians conquests of the Calderon Protectorate and Aurigan Coalition. After these conquests, the Rangers proceeded to smash Comstar's lines under the direction of house Davion, largely changing the course of that conflict.\n\nAfter these high profile contracts, Tobias vanished for sometime, but was spotted aiding the society during their so-called 'Society Summer' invasion.

And he was a big kid. Not too quick on the uptake though. He spent a long time getting bullied before he realized what his size meant, but once he did, he used it to full advantage. And the same thing applied to his schooling. Once he got his teeth into a subject, he absorbed it like a sponge. So when it came time to do something with himself after school, he wanted to go big. And nothing was big like a Battlemech.

The only child of a wealthy Lyran mercantile family, Diego dreamt of ruling the battlefield as a war hero, at the controls of a gilded Zeus; a legend in his own right. When his schooling revealed an easily distracted child with trouble navigating his lessons, his parents knew he would be ill-suited to inherit the family business, but never had the heart to tell him. When he said he wanted to be a Mechwarrior, they knew he needed better grades, and more discipline, and didn’t have the heart to tell him. In the end, money made everything right, and his parents secured him a Battlemech; a washed-up Merc needed cash and they wanted the best for their only boy, so he was hired to train the teenage Diego to be a ‘Mech pilot, and eventually turn his Blackjack over to the Velazquez scion.\r\n\r\nDiego never did learn discipline, and never took no for an answer from his mentor. For two years the aging soldier tried to tutor the boy, and mold him into something resembling a Mechwarrior. But more often than not, the two ended up butting heads, with the elder calling the younger a ‘stubborn goat’, and the youth storming off to do something else less demanding. Eventually, the Mechwarrior’s health started to fail, and while resting in bed he officially turned his decrepit ‘Mech over to Diego, handing him a set of dog tags with ‘Capricorn’ stamped into them, and wishing him luck. Diego never saw the old man die, as he paid passage as soon as he could to Outreach, to find adventure and glory. Unsurprisingly, the headstrong, naive young man lost his ‘Mech, and finally, his misplaced pride. Life had slapped him in the face, and now that his eyes were open to reality, he felt humble, and wished for nothing more than to actually earn himself a spot among a real Mercenary command, and a chance to really earn that which was unfairly bought.",

Yue preferred her role as rapid response fire support, and she wasn't ready to give the chair over to someone who wouldn't appreciate the 'Mech's history. Eventually the brass informed her she had no choice when the next promotion offer came; upgrade or opt out. It's an easy guess what she chose, and it's just as easy to wager why she'd want to sign on with a Mercenary outfit with cause to venture out into the Rimward Periphery.",

She was smart, and ruthless, and someone with her capabilities wasn't long for petty crime.

The pirates were more wily than the low-rent crooks she'd been with, but her savvy kept her fingerprints off most of their heists.\r\n\r\nAfter a duel with a member of a rival pirate crew got blood on her hands for the first time, Pistol started getting a tattoo for each mark she knocked off; often times double-tapping by collecting bounties on the riff-raff as a side gig. That sort of work suited her tastes, and the criminal aspects of things started to fall to the wayside. The other pirates noticed, and not wanting to lose their share of her bounty takes, they offered her a spot among the few 'Mech jocks they had. She was put at the controls of a primitive, derelict Shadow Hawk, and her eye for killing only grew sharper. She found that she equally enjoyed hunting targets with her autocannon or her sidearm, and unfortunately for the rest of the rabble, her resolve to leave the pirate life only got stronger.\r\n\r\nPistol snuck away one evening when the rest of the pirates were in a drunken stupor, leaving word of their whereabouts in the ear of the authorities and collecting the bounty. She used the cash to get off-world, and register with the MRB as a pilot-fore-hire, hoping to shack up with a more reputable lot who favored bounty hunting as much as she did. Amusingly, having to register with the MRB forced her to use her real name (which she hates), so any potential commanders might take care not to use it in casual conversation.",

He had no designs on peeling potatoes and fetching bad coffee for the rest of his life.\r\n\r\nAs he grew up he learned about 'Mech combat, and it took a lot longer for him to get behind the wheel, so to speak, than it did for him to grasp the basics of tactics and strategy, since the latter didn't involve any risks to the outfit's hardware. His callsign, Rhino, is a bit of an in-joke. Turns out just because he's built like one doesn't mean he's anywhere as tough as one. Bit of a glass jaw. Not that you'd want to let a tactical mind like his get bounced around in his skull in a bar fight, mind.",

He would skip school to sneak off and spend time with his mother who worked at Coventry Metal Works to be around the Battlemechs. He would stay up nights, looking at blueprints, studying how myomer works, or building models of his favorite machines. He had a particular fondness for the Hunchback; the massive autocannon put a twinkle in his eyes.\r\n\r\nThanks to his connections, he was able to attend the Conventry Military Academy, and was enrolled in the Reconnaissance program when the Jade Falcons invaded Steiner space. He was there when they attacked Coventry. He fought alongside his training cadre as the Clanners tried to take his home planet. And he, like the rest of his comrades, failed in its defense.

Attached to the Ceti Hassars John would be captured by a Cappellan patrol after an intel snafu failed to warn them of recent movements in the area. Beagle was held prisoner for 4 years and was subject to intense interrogation techniques in the early years of his captivity. On the fourth year Beagle would be sprung from prison by his old unit, now operating as a Mercenary band, and would assist in combat and command of what would later be known as Operation Gatecrasher. John has been running his own Mercenary unit on and off since his new found freedom but has been more recently looking for a company where he can find good return for his skills and experience.",

      "content": "Doyle is a seasoned mercenary pilot who first started his career with Ghost Warriors Brigade. He quickly got frustrated with their lack of drive and ambition and soon found himself signing up and fighting with the Steel Jaguars, a merc unit that prided themselves on their dedication to tough training, hard work and excellence in the field of battle. Before too long Doyle had become an integral part of the battalion he fought for and he found himself fighting in every available mission, building up a wealth of knowledge and experience. Eventually he was given a promotion, but it was his next promotion, one that he never wanted, that would end up shaping his future.\r\n\r\nOne day the Commanding Officer of the battalion walked away from the job, deciding that he was unable continue in his position and quit the life of a mercenary, leaving Doyle to take his post. Doyle didn't want this position, but after looking around and deciding if he left it to someone else they would probably get him killed, he decided to take the job. He then led the battalion through a series of successful missions, but never truly saw eye to eye with the company's owner. There were many straws but one, as they say, finally broke the camel's back and Doyle decided to leave the Steel Jaguars to form his own company from the ground up.\r\n\r\nWhat he didn't expect was for the vast majority of his former battalion to follow him, but many did. So finding himself in possession of almost a full battalion of seasoned merc pilots he struck out with his new company naming them The Sanguine Tigers.

He tested well in the VR-pods and was promptly sent to Coventry Military Academy.  There he excelled in his tactics classes and was put on a fast track for being assigned to a line unit to replace the ever increasing losses during the 3rd Succession War.  Being given an early commission with the severely depleted Sixth Arcturian Guards, Garrison was sent to Starshine at the age of 21.\r\n\r\nOn Starshine he was assigned to be First Leutnant of a Support Lance where he was able to make excellent use of his academy training against pirate raiders and Free Worlds League units.  Where is Starshine you may ask?  Well, don't bother looking for it on star maps, its a dead world now.  What about the Sixth Arcturian Guards?  They no longer show on the rolls of active units for the Commonwealth - yet Garrison was there at the end of both.\r\n\r\nBarely a year into his new assignment, Garrison was thrust right into action.  During the Marik Civil War of 3014 (also known as Anton's Revolt), the Commonwealth decided to take advantage of the situation and sent the Sixth in to raid Griffith.  With the chaos of Anton's Revolt, the 1st Fusiliers of Oriente were slow to respond and the Sixth's raid was considered a rousing success.  During the fighting Garrison would bait the enemy into terrain of his choosing to allow his support lance to pepper the opposing force with indirect fire while performing slow withdrawals toward the other lances in his company.  The Hauptmann of the company took to saying the OpFor got 'Garrisoned' and it wasn't long before it stuck as his call sign.\r\n\r\nReturning to their post at Starshine, the Sixth was celebrating their victory in one of the larger domed habitats when the Fusiliers got their revenge.  Performing a Hover-Drop, a mobile force of Fusiliers attacked, catching the Sixth completely unaware.  Scrambling to get back to his 'Mech, Garrison found he was cut off by the Fusiliers' forces.  Over the next few days he bided his time until opportunity knocked in he form of a Fusiliers Hunchback 4P that was left in the old Sixth depot area for repairs.  Subduing the technicians, Garrison took control of the 'Mech and made to escape the depot.  There are many stories about what happened next, but the one thing every story has in common is that the depot was set off, causing a chain reaction that destroyed the Star League era air purifying system that kept the planetary domes habitable.  This ultimately led to the world being abandoned of the next few years, another casualty of the Succession Wars.\r\n\r\nWhile the 1st Fusiliers of Oriente made it off world mostly intact, the same could not be said for the Sixth, between their losses during the surprise assault, and the destruction of the depot - the Sixth ceased to be a solvent unit.  Garrsioned was one of the few to escape with his life and his new 'Mech.  But, even this bit of luck didn't last.  While in transit to the Jump Point, the Black Raiders pirates took advantage of the chaos and attempted to capture the DropShip ferrying Garrison and his 'Mech.  During a strafing run by a Black Raider AeroSpace Fighter, a freak accident occurred with the restraint system in the MechBay and the LRM pods in the Hunchback triggered, and it seemed that the techs had forgotten to remove the load during the frenzy to get off world.  The explosion caused a systematic failure resulting in the loading bay door opening, and all unsecured equipment was blown into space, including Garrison's HBK-4P.  While the DropShip was able to escape, Garrison was now without a unit, without a world and without a 'Mech.\r\n\r\nConsidering his past and knowing that both the world and unit he last served on have passed from existence, many believe Garrison to be jinxed, and considering how he wound up dispossessed and in the hiring halls, maybe there is something to it.

But this would not be in time to make Evan's life any easier.\r\n\r\nFrom a very early age Evan showed an aptitude for VR combat simulation games, often taking units known to be under powered, yet somehow finessing them to victory.  This eventually led him to seek a career with the military much to his mother's delight and father's grudging tolerance.  He was soon enrolled at the newly formed NAIS, but life there was no picnic, as all his classmates believed him to be there on his parent's accomplishments and not his own merits.
