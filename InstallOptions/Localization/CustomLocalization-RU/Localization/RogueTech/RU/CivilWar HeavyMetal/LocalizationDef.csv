The weaponry is equally impressive, the Vulcan II is equipped with 4 Small Pulse Lasers and 3 Medium Pulse Lasers. Finally, the techs installed eleven double heat sinks, enough to allow a Vulcan II pilot to run and fire all his weapons without overheating. However, jumping poses a problem for careless MechWarriors, and can quickly disable those who ignore the heat meter during a battle.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Narrow/Low Profile</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.02</color></b>";"The Vulcan II VLC-N3 is roughly similar in layout to its predecessor. The N3 offers several new internal features, starting with its 280 extra light fusion engine and seven jump jets. The combination of an XL engine and an Endo Steel chassis permits the new design to carry eight and a half tons of Armor.

"mechdef_vulcan_VL-7M.Description.Details";"The VL-7M retains the Endo Steel skeleton and fusion engine of the VL-5M. However, technicians considered its jump capacity more than sufficient for urban combat, and so reduced it to 120 meters. The weight and space saved by removing the two Jump Jets allows the design to carry seven and one half tons of Ferro-Fibrous Armor, the most protection this 'Mech has had at any time in its history. Furthermore, this is the first Vulcan to feature hand actuators. The new design features a Diverse Optics Extended Range Large Laser in the right torso and replaces the traditional arm-mounted Flamer with two Magna Medium Lasers, giving this Vulcan the punch to take on vehicles and light 'Mechs. A quartet of Magna Mk II Small Pulse Lasers fits snugly into the left arm; power conduits for this accurate anti-personnel array are routed along the same channel once used to feed that arm's single Machine Gun.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Narrow/Low Profile</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.02</color></b>";"The VL-7M retains the Endo Steel skeleton and fusion engine of the VL-5M.
