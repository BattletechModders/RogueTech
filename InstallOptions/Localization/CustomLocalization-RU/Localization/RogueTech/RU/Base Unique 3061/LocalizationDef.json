Barely a second generation OmniMech, the Jade Falcons introduced the Summoner just after becoming the first Clan to win OmniMech technology from Clan Coyote in 2863. A customized variant of the Summoner supposedly piloted by Jade Falcon Star Colonel Aidan Pryde, the Pryde uses an Ultra Autocannon/10 in its left arm, supported by a Ultra Autocannon/5 in the right arm, each with one ton of ammo. The left torso carries an ER small Laser with two Clan Anti Missile Systems and a ton of AMS ammo. A single ER Medium Laser in the right torso rounds out the loadout.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Склонность: Улучш. средства связи</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Множитель стоимости высадки: 1.16</color></b>",
