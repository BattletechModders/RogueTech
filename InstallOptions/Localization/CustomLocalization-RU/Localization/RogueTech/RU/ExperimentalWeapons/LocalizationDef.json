      "content": "This Marauder, commonly reffered as the MAD-DER, was first seen as a Solaris VII speed boosted refit which boasts of an L.A.M. System incorporated to the very mech's chassis and engine, enabling it to go faster and actually fly in short bursts, but doesn't make it an actual ''L.A.M.'', at most it can jump and glide. The procedure changed it to have much better jumping and DFA targetting, perfect for its role as a disabler and a DFA gladiator on Solaris matches. And since it's Solaris VII debut many other expressed their interest in a Heavy Mech with L.A.M.-like capabilites but no other vendors were interested in making such a niche design replicated unless they have deep enough pockets to build something of their own. And while a few who still persevered. This mech was mainly made with the kind of passion for a flying Marauder, whose design was quickly stolen, modified and refitted with several disabler weapons.

      "original": "Developed by Howa Machinery Company Ltd. for the King Dragon, the experimental Ryujin Superheavy Flamer utilizes a totally new concept for delivery of the flammable substance. The weapon charges a 'cloud' of inert nano-particles with an positive charge, which then binds a special ionized highly flammable substance between the particles. Upon impact with a surface the bindings of the nano-particles and the flammable substance are broken, resulting in the ignition of the fluid by the released electrical charge. This allows the flamer to reach much further distances, but also means the heat explosion is considerably less at shorter distances as the kinetic impact will rupture less of the bindings.

      "content": "The Helical Railgun is Clan Steel Viper's recent weapons technology, a further advancement of the standard linear Railgun by combining it with the latest coilgun advancements. The coils are used to charge the firing mechanism considerably faster than normal, allowing the weapon to switch between either a long range, higher damage, single shot attack, or a multi-firing sequence with two or three shots. However, due to the technology limitations the the weapon still is prohibitively heavy and large and can only fit on the largest BattleMechs, and is also prone to misfire if not the proper firing sequence of seven precise steps is used. \n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Uses Helical Railgun Ammo.</color></b> \n\n<b><color=#099ff2>EXTREMELY VOLATILE!</color></b>",

With its imposing size and heavily reinforced armor, the King Dragon was designed to fill the role of the ultimate heavy-hitter on the battlefield, a true Dreadnought. Despite its massive size, the King Dragon is surprisingly agile thanks to its highly balance chassis, making it a formidable opponent even for lighter and more nimble 'Mechs. This agility, combined with its advanced targeting systems and unparalleled firepower, makes the King Dragon a fearsome sight on any battlefield. The King Dragon quickly gained a reputation as one of the most fearsome and unstoppable Superheavy BattleMechs in the Inner Sphere and pilots of the 'Mech quickly became legendary figures in the various wars and conflicts that wracked the region, inspiring awe and fear in equal measure.

Weighting in at 150t and utilizing a 425-rated core, the Ophanim brings Divine Wrath in its arms, and the Blessed Rains in the side torsos. Those hoping that great weight given to the weaponry has cost it armor protection, will find that the Spirit of Blake has been blessed on this Sanctus Armor, helping to lift the load from those going to preach the Truth under fire. Included as well, is a Blessed Gyro, and Seraphim EWAR Suite, both given blessings by the highest priests of the order, which has had some positive effects on combat performance. And to drive home the point that this is a model just for those who truly believe, it requires the pilot to have undergone significant cyberfication, to the point of almost embedding them into the cockpit.",
