A Plasma Rifle provides respectable firepower and forces conventional units to reconsider attacking the Infernus variant. A Medium Pulse Laser provides a more accurate weapon. A rear-mounted ER Small Laser makes small units think twice about attacking the 'Mech's rear. Like the Invictus, this configuration can also jump up to 120 meters.";;"#000000";"#FFFFFF"

The Perseus shares much with the venerable Orion, a staple of Free Worlds League Military, both broadly resembling the older design visually and using a number of the same components. This similarity prompted more than a few FWLM technicians to nickname the new design the Omni-Orion and the deployment of Perseus has largely been to front-line units that fielded large concentrations of its progenitor, replacing older Orions on a one-for-one basis. Built on a lightweight Endo Steel chassis, the Perseus is powered by a Hermes 300 XL engine helping save even more weight and giving the 'Mech a top speed of 64.8 km/h. The advanced structure and engine save a great deal of weight for weapons and equipment. The Perseus is protected by fourteen tons of Valiant Lamellor armor, giving it around average armor protection for a 'Mech of its size. It also has twelve double heat sinks that are fixed on the chassis.
