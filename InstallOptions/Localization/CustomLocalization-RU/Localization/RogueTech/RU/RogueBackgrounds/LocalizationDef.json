They can be quick to anger, but they are nonetheless skilled and perceptive combatants. \n\nFounded as a constitutional monarchy under the leadership of [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreHouseCalderon],House Calderon]], the Taurian Concordat is the strongest military power of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreRimwardPeriphery],Rimward Periphery]]. It is also one of the oldest surviving realms of human civilization, having been formed long before the creation of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreStarLeague],Star League]]. Taurian citizens enjoy extensive freedoms guaranteed by the Concordat Charter, and take pride in defending those freedoms through compulsory service. The Taurian Concordat has long had an antagonistic relationship with the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreInnerSphere],Inner Sphere]], particularly with the [[DM.Factions[faction_Davion],Federated Suns]].",
