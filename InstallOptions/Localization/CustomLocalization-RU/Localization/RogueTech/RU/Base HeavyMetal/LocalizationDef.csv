The SRM-2 has been removed to upgrade the Medium Laser to a Medium Pulse Laser and an Artemis IV fire control system has been added for the LRM-5 launcher. Within the CCAF, TDF and MAF it is largely used as a cheap way to rebuild shattered forces and sees service mostly in green and reserve formations. The Capellans in particular use the -23 as a fire-support unit for pursuit and strike lances, though shortages of Artemis munitions means many are forced to use mine-delivery missiles.
