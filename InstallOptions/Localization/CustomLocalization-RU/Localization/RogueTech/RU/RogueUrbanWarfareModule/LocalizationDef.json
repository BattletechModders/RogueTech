Slow by LAM standards and drastically under gunned by Urbanmech standards, this mech struggles to fill either role. That said, the shock factor of an Urbanmech LAM deployed against uninformed opponents, has allowed it a measure of success when used as a raider. Dual ER Mediums and a bevy of rockets provide a nasty punch at close quarters, but prove mediocre at longer ranges. The only known examples of this mech were were recovered by the DMI and were turned over to the NAIS, though their current status is unknown.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Land Air Mech</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 0.99</color></b>",
