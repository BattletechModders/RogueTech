Clan forces tried to seize a military base locked before the Exodus, rumoured to hold Lostech. Despite narrowly turning back the assault the base is held but contact is lost with the ship. In orbit, the expedition commander cowardly decides to nuke the site and claims the unit has defected. The few survivors, branded traitors, are forced to scatter to survive. \n\n ",
