    "Details": "There are those who grow up knowing what it means to want, and then there are those as blessed as Diego Velazquez. The only child of a wealthy Lyran mercantile family, Diego dreamt of ruling the battlefield as a war hero, at the controls of a gilded Zeus; a legend in his own right. When his schooling revealed an easily distracted child with trouble navigating his lessons, his parents knew he would be ill-suited to inherit the family business, but never had the heart to tell him. When he said he wanted to be a Mechwarrior, they knew he needed better grades, and more discipline, and didn’t have the heart to tell him. In the end, money made everything right, and his parents secured him a Battlemech; a washed-up Merc needed cash and they wanted the best for their only boy, so he was hired to train the teenage Diego to be a ‘Mech pilot, and eventually turn his Blackjack over to the Velazquez scion.\r\n\r\nDiego never did learn discipline, and never took no for an answer from his mentor. For two years the aging soldier tried to tutor the boy, and mold him into something resembling a Mechwarrior. But more often than not, the two ended up butting heads, with the elder calling the younger a ‘stubborn goat’, and the youth storming off to do something else less demanding. Eventually, the Mechwarrior’s health started to fail, and while resting in bed he officially turned his decrepit ‘Mech over to Diego, handing him a set of dog tags with ‘Capricorn’ stamped into them, and wishing him luck. Diego never saw the old man die, as he paid passage as soon as he could to Outreach, to find adventure and glory. Unsurprisingly, the headstrong, naive young man lost his ‘Mech, and finally, his misplaced pride. Life had slapped him in the face, and now that his eyes were open to reality, he felt humble, and wished for nothing more than to actually earn himself a spot among a real Mercenary command, and a chance to really earn that which was unfairly bought.",
