    "Details": "Sketchy comes from a nearly-forgotten corner of space that was once very, very important to the goings-on of the Inner Sphere. A long time ago, the world she hails from, Otisberg, was part of the Rim World Republic; the nation that toppled the first Star League and led to the ruination of House Cameron. After the Amaris Civil War, and later the Republic-Commonwealth War, what remained of the RWR faded into obscurity, along with most of the worlds the Lyrans didn't lay claim to. But in 3040, the spark of nationhood was lit again by a man named James Moroney, who joined a movement set on unifying the worlds of Otisberg, Gillfillan's Gold, All Dawn, Calgarium, Slewis, and Waypoint into an alliance. Unfortunately, James Moroney was killed, and his friend William Roberts was left to see the transition to completion. A mercenary unit, Able's Aces, was hired to provide security and training to the new nation, and one of the first people in line to learn was Moroney's niece, Belinda.\r\n\r\nSketchy proved to have a mind for tactics, specifically those mired in the ebb and flow of an ongoing battle; her reactionary skills being quite commendable even if her judgement calls often times seemed questionable in the moment. However, when she graduated from training with the Aces, she chose to leave the Rim Collection instead of becoming part of its burgeoning military; her reasoning being that if she left to gain experience elsewhere, she could return to teach the next generation. After all, how was it that the Aces learned all they taught? It wasn't by sitting on their asses. So she chose to tour the Periphery for a time, learning and growing as a warrior before heading back home to share her experience with her comrades-at-arms.",
