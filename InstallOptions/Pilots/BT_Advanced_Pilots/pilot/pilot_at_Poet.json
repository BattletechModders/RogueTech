    "Details": "Not every person behind the controls of a ‘Mech chooses to be there. Sometimes their options are limited due to the circumstances of their birth. Annabelle Geates was born in the officer’s quarters of a Leopard-class dropship, en route between worlds in the Free World’s League. Her mother was the CO of a mercenary group; her father a pilot. They had been trying to get to a proper hospital, but the trip from the jump point in-system was a long one, and Annabelle ended up being born a few days early. Her entire childhood was spent aboard the ship, with the crew and techs and pilots being her aunts and uncles. She learned about PPCs, and about KF drives, and jump jets, and tactics. She had few toys, but several of the Mercs had books, so she read a lot as soon as she was able. Books became her escape when the hull of the Leopard rumbled from meteorites or weapons fire and she was afraid. They taught here everything she learned that didn’t have a military application. Her parents wanted her to learn the family business, but she wanted to go into the arts. She loved writing, and would read her prose to anyone that would listen to her.\r\n\r\nAs she grew up, she found herself behind the controls of her mother’s Phoenix Hawk, learning the ropes. It was the last place she wanted to be, but she had few other choices. Her parents were worried about leaving her someplace to study, only to be kidnapped or worse by someone upset with the unit. So Annabelle became a Mechwarrior.\r\n\r\nHer parents eventually had a falling out, and the group dissolved. Both parents joined different outfits, and she chose to live with her father for a time, but the group he’d signed up with were too rowdy for her tastes, so she left. She missed the more family-like environment of her old unit. She met up with her mother, but she was bitter about Annabelle choosing her father first, and they had a falling out. Left with few prospects, Geates put her name out looking for a new outfit; one that she hopes has a quiet corner for her to read and write in, between contracts. And maybe, a new kind of family more like her old one.",
