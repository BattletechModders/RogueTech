    "Details": "The saying 'Nice guys finish last' has some truth to it sometimes; at least in the case of Gavin Oikos at any rate. He certainly plays at being a nice guy, and he's not shy about honestly admitting he finished last in his class at the Legionary Training Academy. But he finished, he likes to quip. He takes a quiet pride in his homeworld of Andurien, and is less quiet about his love of Capellan jokes. He gets as well as he gives though, and prides himself on having never started a barroom brawl. He'll joke that he's finished a few though.\r\n\r\nZed gets his callsign from his graduating class; they dubbed him 'Zed' because he was always last place in everything, even if at the same time he never really failed at anything either. He'll jest about all the best callsigns having some truth to them, of course. Unfortunately his cheerful exterior is the shimmery wrapping paper around a very sad little box. It's no mean task to check his records, and see that he went to the academy because his family, down to a person, died in an outbreak carried to his locale on Andurien by an offworlder, and the money he spent to do so was what remained of their financial legacy. There isn't anything or anyone left now but Zed, and his quirky sense of humor. He can't seem to stop being last.",
