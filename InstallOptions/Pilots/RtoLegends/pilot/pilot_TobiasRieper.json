    "Details": "A member of the so-called 'Ghosts of Skye', or more colloquially known as the 'Rangers', little background information is available on the mysterious Tobias Rieper.\n\nFrom his own public statements, Tobias was born on the world of Skye, as apparently all members of the ghosts are. Orphaned at an early age, Tobias became a ward of the state, having no living relatives after a rare chemical attack on the world during the closing days of the Fourth Succession War. Too young to remember his family, Tobias was adopted by members of the order and trained from a young age in the ways of warfare.\n\nUpon coming to the age of majority, Tobias was enrolled into the LCAF, and by the powers that be, was assigned to the elite 4th Skye Rangers, which according to Tobias all members of the Ghosts serve in for at least some period of time. Here Tobias distinguished himself, eventually even coming to the attention of the FedCom Archon-Prince after saving the Archon-Prince's life from a would-be assassin. Grateful to the young mechwarrior, the Archon gifted Tobias with a unique variant of the time-tested Orion mech, equipped with the very best tech available to the state.\n\nTobias used this mech to great effect, and although he left the LCAF shortly before the outbreak of the Clan invasion, Tobias would fight along side his old unit and his fellow ghosts during the Clan Invasion and himself participated in Operation Serpent.\n\nFollowing the end of the Clan-created crisis, Tobias disappeared from the public, but was later known to have been active during the FedCom Civil war and the Blakist Jihad that followed. \n\nAs war once again engulfed the sphere following Comstar's invasion of the nascent Republic of the Sphere, the Ghosts decided to make themselves known again, this time as mercenaries for hire. Although Tobias was chosen to be their public point of contact, he was clear that he was not their leader, rather he had been forced into the role as the result of a lost bet with someone known as 'Byrd'. From here, Tobias could be found on several fronts of the war, aiding the Taurians conquests of the Calderon Protectorate and Aurigan Coalition. After these conquests, the Rangers proceeded to smash Comstar's lines under the direction of house Davion, largely changing the course of that conflict.\n\nAfter these high profile contracts, Tobias vanished for sometime, but was spotted aiding the society during their so-called 'Society Summer' invasion. Finally, under the direction of the mysterious council that runs the Ghosts, Tobias and several regiments of Rangers were sent coreward on a mission to claim ownership of clan Cloud Cobra. Here it was revealed that Tobias was a descendant of the Riaz family and under clan laws had possible claims to the Riaz bloodname. After winning the right to bloodname, Tobias engaged the khan of the Cobras in a trial of position, a trial he won with relative ease and in so doing became khan of the clan.\n\nWhile most clanners were not happy with this, they had little choice to obey as Tobias stirred the Cobras into an invasion of the Ghost Bear Dominion. After a protracted Trial of Possession for 59 worlds of the Bears, the Cobras under Tobias emerged victorious with the aid of the ghost regiments now integrated into the clan. From there, under orders, Tobias proceeded to invade his homeworld of Skye, taking the world under command of the council.\n\nThen Tobias was issued one final set of orders, which he executed in the closing days of the war. Taking advantage of their momentum against the republic, Tobias laid siege to and successfully claimed Terra, becoming ilKhan in the process and making Cloud Cobra the ilClan. At the same time, Cobra forces executed a daring attack on the clan homeworld of Strana Mechty, claiming it for themselves.\n\nFor the next several decades Tobias ruled over the Cloud Cobras and eventually returned the world of Skye to Lyran control, evidently the council's overall goal for the entire operation. Some fifty years later, at the age of 92 Tobias finally passed away, becoming the oldest living Khan ever, and the only one for the Cobra's to pass away due to old age, having successfully fended off dozens of challenges for the position over that time span.",
