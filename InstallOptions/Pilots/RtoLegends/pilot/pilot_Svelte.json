    "Details": "Svelte Sobral is something of an oddity amongst the well known mechwarriors within the Inner Sphere. While regarded as a great mechwarrior, this is not what Svelte is known for. Nor is he amongst those infamous for war crimes. Instead, Svelte is known for being cursed.\n\nNo one is sure how or why he is cursed, only that bad luck seems to befall all his employers shortly after the end of his contracts with them. Svelte has found himself blamed for the collapse of the Rasalhague Dominion, the Aurigan Directorate, a Free Worlds League-wide HPG blackout and a failed Wolf invasion of the Magistracy of Canopus.\n\nAs a member of the so-called \"The New Wolverines\", many questions have been raised by his employers, including questions of his origin, any allegiances and who or what were the old wolverines if they are the new ones? Svelte however, doesn't seem to ever answer these questions.\n\nDespite his cursed nature, Svelte still finds employers willing to employ his services, hoping to avoid the curse that seems to follow him around.\n\nEven after the collapse and disbanding of TNW, Svelte could be found fighting for one cause for another before ultimately disappearing. What exactly happened to the mighty mechwarrior is not exactly known, some say his curse finally caught up with him proper and even stranger rumors suggest he was disembodied and turned into a sentient fax machine by the mysterious Casparamaris and left at some backwater location of the Golden Corral.",
