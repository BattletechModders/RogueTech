    "Details": "What drives a mercenary? For some its the thrill of battle, for others its the chance to fight for a righteous cause. Others still are in it only for the money or to commit warcrimes. Blaen however is after only one thing: Salvage.\n\nWhile no records confirm it, Blaen himself states he was born and raised on Arlanda, a system once part of the the former Rim Worlds Republic and according to Comstar, long since abandoned. Blaen won't say much more about his upbringing or how we was able to leave a system no jumpships would visit. However he escaped, it is clear that Blaen has been hunting all forms of lostech he can get on the battlefield.\n\nIt is said that many factions are overjoyed to have a mechwarrior of his ability to join their ranks, but are sad when he leaves after he has acquired what technology he was hunting. Such is his reputation that even strict clans such as Jade Falcon have been known to hire him. \n\nAs a cautionary tale, if you wish to hire Blaen, make sure you have the tech to give him because once it dries up, he will move on to another who does have it. Many have questioned what Blaen does with his horde of technology given that it rarely shows back up on the market, and some suggest he is secretly smuggling it back to his homeworld, but for what purpose no one knows.\n",
