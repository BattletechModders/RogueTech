    "Details": "Hailing from the deep-periphery, the exact origins of the mercenary known as 'Sierra3' remain unknown, although a slight spanish accent in his speech strongly suggests that he either hails from, or has spent significant time in the distant Nueva Castile.\n\nAppearing as a rough figure, often seen sporting a Stetson-styled hat and a long trench-coat, evoking images of 'Wild West' of the ancient Terran nation of America, with a personality to match. Sierra3 can be summed up as 'all business, no play' when it comes to his work and takes any job he accepts with the utmost seriousness and professionalism.\n\nFavouring lighter mechs, usually equipped with relatively 'low-tech' but reliable and easy to repair parts, Sierra3 is known to track his quarries across the stars at a relentless pace that few can match. However, do not believe that these choices hinder him in any way, as he is known to be an incredible duelist and has a near impeccable record with the MRBC for completing the contracts he takes on.\n\nGiven his often grim personality, his somewhat reclusive nature and nomadic work, it is little wonder that Sierra3 has few whom he calls friends. For those who have earned this title though, Sierra3 will go to any lengths to protect and if necessary, avenge.\n",
