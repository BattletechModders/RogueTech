    "Details": "Corrine Marik was one of the Free Worlds League's odder chapters in its long history. Appointed to the position of Captain-General at a young age, after the death of her mother and older brother, Corrine proved to be ill-prepared for the position.\n\nAn idealist at heart, Corrine, along with her peers attempted to form the '3rd Star League'. When she left Atreus to head to St. Ives, Corrine had no idea she would never return. When the attack on Ives came, Corrine simply vanished and became an early casualty of the battle.\n\nThings took a twist when a short time later Corrine returned to Atreus, only to be revealed as an imposter and body-double when a broadcast of the real Corrine made its way to the FWL. Further investigations would turn up an entire dumpster of clones behind a Golden Corral. In the months and years to follow, stranger twists would continue with occasional sightings of Corrine's battlemech on distant battlefields outside the FWL. Further sightings in the coming months on mysterious OnlyNyans feeds, and holo-images of her dressed in viking attire, further fueled rumors of her and the FWL being centered in a \"JarnFolk\" conspiracy all while the FWL collapsed. Needless to say, few within house Marik are willing to speak about Corrine and have made active efforts to remove all trace of her whenever possible.\n",
