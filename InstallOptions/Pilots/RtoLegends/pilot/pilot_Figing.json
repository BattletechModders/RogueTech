    "Details": "Dart \"Figing\" Scarsson was born on Hofn to the great Scarsson family. A student of the JarnFolk's history, Figing grew up dreaming of revenge against the Draconis Combine for the centuries of persecution his people had suffered. Surviving several attempts on his life by members of other families, Figing eventually became the head of his family at a relatively young age.\n\nDetermined and wise, Figing bided his time, then struck the other families one by one, installing new heads that were more agreeable to his ideals. Through this he managed to end the centuries of disputes and united the JarnFolk for the first time.\n\nWith the help of the mysterious Jarl Jarlson, Figing militarized the JarnFolk with battlemech technology for the first time and then launched strikes against the Combine. The Combine was caught completely off guard and they crumbled against the JarnFolk's might.\n\nUpon learning of the Clans, it is said that Figing enlarged his dreams from conquering the Combine to also forcing the clans to recognize the JarnFolk as 'clan SpruceFist'.\n\nThroughout his life, Figing was known for his use of strange phrases and ancient terms that seemed out of place, in particular he puzzled many with repeated mutterings of 'gulags' and 'kink crabs'\n",
