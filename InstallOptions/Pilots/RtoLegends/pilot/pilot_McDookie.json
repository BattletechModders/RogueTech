    "Details": "Primus Heya 'McDookie' Kerensky Vickers, was one of Comstar's most well-known Primus'. Born to one of the few remaining members of the Kerensky family on Terra, McDookie grew up hearing stories of the Star League and his distant relative and became inspired to create a new star league. Rising through the ranks of Comstar faster than most, McDookie eventually found himself appointed to the position of Primus, and was the youngest ever to be appointed to the role.\n\nUsing his charisma and charm, McDookie embarked on a campaign to re-unify the fractured inner sphere in what he called the 3rd Star League (despite there never having been a 2nd). By all accounts, he would have succeeded if the conference on St. Ives to sign the accords had not been attacked by an unknown force. While McDookie survived this attempt on his life, he was gravely wounded and was unable to lead Comstar again for some time. By the time of his return, McDookie found Comstar's power and prestige greatly diminished, though he once again worked to rebuild it.",
