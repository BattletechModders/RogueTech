    "Details": "Khan Han Hill, also known as the so-called 'Iron Khan' is one of Clan Coyote's most celebrated heroes. Though not well known outside of his clan, the Iron Khan is credited with reversing the slow decline of the Coyotes following their dominance after the invention of the OmniMech in the golden century.\n\nCritically wounded during the Wars of Reaving, Han's survival was considered miraculous, as was his fast return to the battlefield. Earning the respect of his peers, Han was a natural choice for the Khanship of the clan when Khan Leo Koga died in a trial defending the Coyotes' honour amongst the other clans in the wake of the Society invasion.\n\nUnder Han's rule, the Coyotes were able to regain much of their lost standing in the eyes of their peers, though this came at the cost of becoming bitter enemies with Clan Blood Spirit. Seeing the Spirit's ever shifting demands, Han lead a coalition of the remaining homeworld clans to expel the Blood Spirits, exiling them to Colleen and the invasion corridor.\n\nAfter a war to keep the Magistracy of Canopus out of the K-Cluster, Han decided that the homeworld clans must once more invade the Inner Sphere, as it was clear that there was no way to prevent the taint of the Inner Sphere away from their homes without its conquest.\n\nLeading the Coyotes, Stone Lions, Star Adders & Cloud Cobras towards the Sphere, they were rebuffed by the juggernaut that was Clan Ghost Bear and it was made clear that they would not allow the homeworld clans to pass through their space. This forced the Coyotes to retreat for a time, but undeterred, Han decided that they would instead travel through the invasion corridor and avoid Ghost Bear space.\n\nThis unfortunately would mean pushing through the exiled Blood Spirits, and so Han started an invasion of their space. For the next three years, the Coyotes and Blood Spirits fought to a near standstill and neither were able to make significant passage through the corridor. During this time, Han earned his lasting callsign of 'Iron Khan' for his determination to reach the sphere. Eventually both clans came to grudgingly respect one another and slowly they began to co-operate to reach the sphere. Eventually Han reached the space of the Hanseatic League only to discover that they had arrived too late and were now blockaded from entering the near periphery once more by the Ghost Bears.\n\nThe Coyotes and Ghost Bears fought a brief war in the stars between the League and the Chainelane Isles, but ultimately the Coyotes were not able to match the Bears and all seemed lost for Han's quest.\n\nHowever, it soon turned out that the Society was not as defeated as once thought and it was revealed they had infiltrated the MRBC. As the Society's chaos swept through the Sphere, the Coyotes slipped into Davion space,  eventually settling a sector of periphery space near the Taurian Concordat. Relations between the clan and House Davion quickly soured and the Coyotes found themselves soon in battle against the Federated Suns.\n\nAround this time, the Primus of ComStar and the Aurgian Coalition offered the Coyotes a chance to join the so-called 'New Star-League'. With little to lose, Han chose to align himself with this new alliance and by war's end several years later, the Coyotes found themselves to be one of major clan's operating within the Sphere, second to only the irksome Ghost Bears.\n\nThough the 'New Star-League' fell apart in the years after the war, the Coyotes were well positioned to dominate the area against their former allies, while a burgeoning alliance formed between Han and his former enemies in Clan Blood Spirit. \n\nNever destined to become the ilKhan of the Clans, Han nonetheless represented the rebirth of his Clan and for decades to come, his influence was felt in the Kerensky Cluster as the Coyotes dominated it once more.\n",
