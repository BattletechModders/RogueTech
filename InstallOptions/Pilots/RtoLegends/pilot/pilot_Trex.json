    "Details": "Trex \"Kamea\" Arano, was the daughter of Kamea Arano. Trex was often simply called Kamea the Second due to her near identical looks to her mother, so much so that historians have difficulty figuring out which holo-images to attribute to either one. \n\nBorn only a few years after her mother's victory over Santiago Espinosa's Directorate, Trex grew up watching as her people struggled in the post-wars years to rebuild and became determined to help her people no matter the cost.\n\nTrex ascended to the throne at the age of 19, when her mother decided that she had ruled long enough and stepped down as High Lady of the Reach. Like her mother before her, Trex proved a natural leader and was able to inspire her people to not only make the Aurigan Reach prosperous for a periphery state, but was even able to successfully defend and launch a counter offensive against the Capellan Confederation. It is said that Trex herself planned and led the campaign that seized chancellor Slippy's personal salt mine and drove him insane. \n\nAfter the war Trex returned her focus on making her nation the best that it could be before handing down the throne to a new generation of leadership like her mother before her, setting a tradition within the reach of the voluntarily giving up power before old age and world weariness caught up with the High Lord/Lady.\n",
