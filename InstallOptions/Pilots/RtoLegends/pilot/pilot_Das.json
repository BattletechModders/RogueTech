    "Details": "A former Captain-General of the Free-Worlds-League and one of the few non-Mariks to hold the title, Das is rarely spoken about in the league, having resided over its near downfall. After leaving office Das was revealed to be a member of the so called 'New Wolverines', a group no one in the Inner Sphere is sure about. Whatever her origin, Das constantly finds herself blamed for everything that goes wrong around them, somehow including a sphere-wide mech supercharger shortage",
