After leaving office Das was revealed to be a member of the so called 'New Wolverines', a group no one in the Inner Sphere is sure about. Whatever her origin, Das constantly finds herself blamed for everything that goes wrong around them, somehow including a sphere-wide mech supercharger shortage",
