    "Details": "Jack Amaris, better known as \"Captain Jack\" was born on some world that was once part of the long dead Rim Worlds Republic. Growing up hearing stories of his distant relative and taught from a young age that house Steiner was to blame for the hardships forced on his world because of their destruction of the RWR, Jack turned to a life of piracy at the young age of 16.\n\nRising through the ranks fairly quickly, it became apparent that Jack had an affinity for fixing and understanding lostech, in particular he was fascinated by the HPG network administered by Comstar.\n\nJack was eventually made captain of his crew after the previous captain came down with a good old fashion case of being Atlas stomped. As captain, Jack launched raids into the Lyran Commonwealth, and after accidentally capturing a world with a functional HPG, Jack at last had a chance to take an in-depth study of it.\n\nAs a result of this study, Jack was able to successfully create a miniature version of HPG technology with a shorter range. Calling his invention \"Wifi\" after an ancient Terran wireless communication technology, Jack led the Valkyrate pirates in an attempt to spread this new technology to all worlds in their reach. Favouring the use of scavenged Atlas mechs to turn into \"wifi towers\", Jack eventually created their own network of systems and a pirated content network, much to the annoyance of Comstar.\n\nOn more than one occasion, Jack raided the Lyran capital of Tharkad to acquire more Atlas towers. Eventually Jack was forced to retreat from the front due to health, but the Valkyrate carried on his work, plundering the Commonwealth. Jacks final contribution was helping with inventing the amazing GoatFi technology.",
