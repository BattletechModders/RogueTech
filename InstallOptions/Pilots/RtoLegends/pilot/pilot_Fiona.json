    "Details": "Brilliant, unconventional & heretic. These are all words used to describe Fiona Kerensky, the so-called \"High-Khan\" of Clan Wolf. An inheritor of the fabled Kerensky bloodname tracing back Nicholas Kerensky himself, Fiona was born and raised in a typical wolf sibko.\n\nHowever, Fiona was destined to become anything but typical. Considered a Ristar within the clan, Fiona rose to the khanship of the clan younger than any before her. What followed has been described as either golden age of the Clan Wolf or its darkest depending on who you talk to.\n\nDespite coming from the bloodline of the founder himself, Fiona greatly resented the way the clans were stuck in their traditions. Too rigid and afraid of change, keeping them stuck from becoming truly great. Seeking to correct this, Fiona caused a great uproar amongst the clans when she took the title \"High-Khan\" and immediately appointed a second sakahn. While many clans, including the mighty Clan Ghost Bear decried this very unclan-like behaviour, they were unable to do much as Clan Wolf set out along the exodus corridor towards the Inner Sphere.\n\nReaching the Inner-Sphere, and mostly forsaking the clan tradition of Zellbrigen, Clan Wolf soon build itself a mighty empire, carving out large regions of Draconis Combine and the Free Worlds League.\n\nFiona's high point was her rise to the status of Ilkhan after the wolves took temporary control of Terra. While the Ghost Bears and several other clans denounced the feat upon learning that the wolves had bargained for temporary control instead of conquest, they proved unable to stop Fiona's rise.\n\nFrom here sadly, the fortunes of Wolf and Fiona began to turn. The Wolves lost stewardship of Strana Mechty to the Ghost Bears and much of their empire within the doomed DC was lost. No where is the ultimate fate of Fiona recorded, some say the wolves were brayed by the mad Emperor Majorian and his right-hand Somaru in a batchall, others say Fiona simply ruled the remains of the Wolf Empire until eventually another challenger successfully won Khanship from her. Yet others say she simply disappeared altogether. \n\nWhat is known is that after her rule of the clan ended, the Wolves largely returned to clan traditions and mostly tried to bury the history of Fiona. However, in some circles her unconventional ways are still remembered and held dear, with some promising to bring back the ways of the High-Khan should they ever be in the position to do so.",
