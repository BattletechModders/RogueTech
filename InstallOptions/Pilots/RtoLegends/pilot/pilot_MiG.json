    "Details": "Kommodore Gerheardt Forsythe, better known by his callsign of MiG, once served as the head of the LCAF. Unlike most Lyran officers before or since, MiG was not a social general and rose through the ranks of the LCAF by sheer ability, giving him an edge over most of his opponents who judged him to be like any other Steiner officer. A natural tactician, MiG eschewed many long-held Lyran military tactics, so much so that LCAF records record an attempted court-martial after MiG told another general that assault mechs are not always the answer.\n\nMiG became a household name and hero within the Commonwealth for his role in defending Goat Path and saving the much beloved supply of fresh goat milk from vicious pirate activity. Believed to have been killed in action, just days before his scheduled retirement, MiG was last seen bravely fighting against a massive Valkyrate invasion.",
