    "Details": "Born on New Avalon to one of the Federated Suns most respected noble families, it was clear from a young age that Ianaandru was a gifted and charismatic speaker. School records from his preschool, indicate he regularly made deals and trades with his peers, getting them to do what he wanted without giving up much in return. Such charisma did not go unnoticed by house Davion and Ianaandru quickly found himself fast tracked through a prestigious military academy where he graduated at the top of his class (by making deals with his teachers if some rumors are to be believed) and landed a high ranking post within the AFFS diplomatic corps.\n Here Ianaandru's skills found themselves put to good work and only a few years later he found himself promoted to the head of the corps. Since then, Ianaandru has greatly expanded the size and reach of the corps, opening diplomatic relations with virtually every major and minor power or faction he can find. Ianaandru is so fond of diplomatic wheeling and dealing that AFFS records note he has even tried to open diplomatic relations with an advanced Star-League Era AI known as 'Roguebot' and an Elder God known as 'The Server Overlord' ",
