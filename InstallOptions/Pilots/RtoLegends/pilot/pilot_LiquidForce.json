    "Details": "Born on the world of Lone Star, Glyndwr \"Liquidforce\" Gunvald, grew up dreaming of the knights of ancient Terra and their battles. Born to a family with long held military traditions, Glyndwr's mother served as a mechwarrior within the elite royal divisions of the SLDF and his father a well respected mechtech in the standard SLDF corps.  \n\nWith an upbringing like this, it is little wonder that Glyndwr eventually came to see Mechwarriors as the modern incarnation of the knights of legend and aspired to become one of them. To further this goal, Glyndwr studied hard, eventually applying to and being accepted to the War Academy of Mars. Glyndwr graduated several years later, ranking amongst the top of his class and immediately accepted a role with the 218th Royal Light Horse Regiment.\n\nBeing one of the few to survive the destruction of the unit during the periphery uprising Glyndwr was assigned to independent operations within the occupied Terran Hegemony. Smuggled onto worlds with the goal of helping organize local Hegemony garrison survivors, Glyndwr was assigned the new callsign \"Liquidforce\" to help keep his identity a secret from Amaris soldiers.\n\nBy the end of the war, he had served in campaigns to liberate or organize uprisings on 28 different Hegemony worlds, participating in the battle for Unity city itself on Terra.\n\nWhile most of the SLDF eventually left with General Kerensky, Glyndwr opted to stay behind, having become more determined than ever to see the Hegemony restored to its former glory. Now serving under Lauren Hayes, Glyndwr would become one of the founding members of the Comguard, helping organize and execute operation Silver Shield.\n\nThroughout the first succession war, the Comguard took advantage of Glyndwr's experience to carry out many small, but meaningful operations that required the skills he had obtained over the course of the Amaris crisis. This led Glyndwr all over known space, sometimes operating as a mercenary or infiltrating the military command of various states, all with the goal of furthering ComStar's strategic interests.\n\nTowards the end of his active career, the now aging Glyndwr assumed the role of training the next generation of Comguard operatives and it would be his students that would eventually go on to carry out much of operation Holy Shroud.\n\nWhile it has never been confirmed, some documents unearthed centuries later by Chandrasekhar Kurita suggest that Glyndwr may have also been a founding member of what would eventually become the Word of Blake.",
