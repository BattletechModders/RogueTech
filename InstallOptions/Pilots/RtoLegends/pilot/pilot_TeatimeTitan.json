    "Details": "\"Merchant of Death,\" \"Reaper of Detroit,\" \"Traitor\" & \"just a typical Capellan.\" These are all titles that have been used to describe the figure known as \"Ruin,\" \"Rapture\" & \"Teatime.\" Little concrete information is available about this figure. Even the secret records of the Capellan Confederation offer precious few details other than recording that he is a Capellan citizen.\n\nA deeper dive into some unofficial channels seem to indicate that Teatime was a Maskirovka agent once tasked with advising the Chancellor himself. At some point during this assignment, it seems that Teatime went rogue and used his influence to betray several allies of the Confederation.\n\nRevealed as the root of the betrayal, Teatime was forced to flee, taking on several aliases. Over the course of the next several years, Teatime kept busy by plying the trade routes of Capellan and Canopian space under the guise of a weapons merchant. However, it was eventually found that much of his merchandise was stolen from the Magistracy of Canopusâ€™ own stockpiles and those of the neighbouring Andurien state.\n\nNow hunted by three governments and their agents, Teatime fled to the world of Detroit. On Detroit, forces from all three nations converged to capture the man. However, thanks to years of training, Teatime not only eluded his would be capturers, but turned them against one another. As the three forces battled for who would capture the rogue agent, Teatime unleashed a store of chemical weapons on the planet, decimating its population, along with his hunters. \n\nFollowing the Detroit massacre, Teatime disappeared for several more years, eventually surfacing once more, this time at the head of a mercenary band under the employ of the Society during their invasion of the Inner Sphere using the subverted MRBC.\n\nFinally Teatime disappeared altogether, with no confirmed sightings since. Mysteriously, the Capellan records of his crimes and most other documents regarding him vanished at roughly the same time. \n\nSome unconfirmed theories resound that state that teatime did not actually betray the Confederation at all. Instead they hypothesize he remains a Maskirovka agent, playing out a long and subtle operation. What the aim of this operation is varies from one theory to another, but if any are true, then every citizen in the Sphere should fear what one of the most dangerous Maskirovka agents has in store.",
