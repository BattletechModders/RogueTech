    "Details": "A cunning and ruthless dictator, Majorian was the first non-O'Reilly to ever reign over the Marian Hegemony. Majorian's rise to power differed little from that of the O'Reilly family, rising from a high ranking position and launching a coup d'etat. Once in power Majorian killed or exiled the bulk of the O'Reilly family to prevent them from reclaiming the throne.\n\nDrunk on power, Majorian began a policy of expansion into the faltering Free Worlds League, often deriding the once great successor state as little more than \"free real estate\". Majorian's cruelty did not go unnoticed and eventually brought them into open war with clan Wolf.\n\nThe war with Wolf went poorly and in order to make peace, Majorian was forced to abdecate his throne and become a bondsman to the clan.\n\nMajorian's bondsmanship lasted several years, before he was able to free himself. With the clan distracted by other issues, Majorian quietly slipped back into the hegemony and quickly rebuilt support, forcing Hans O'Reilly out and to flee to the Circinus Federation.\n\nMajorian quickly renewed his war mongering, launching a conquest of the neighbouring Magistracy of Canopus. Catching the Magistracy largely unprepared, the Hegemony ultimately conquered much of Canopus, despite support from numerous allies bolstering the MAF.\n\nMajorian's rule went unimpeded for several years, until the attempted return of Hans O'Reilly with forces of the Circinus Federation launching surprise operation to put O'Reilly back on throne. Unfortunately for the pirates, the Marian's forces seemed to have had some warning of the invasion and were well prepared, repelling the pirates and pushing them back in a counter invasion. Ultimately this cost the federation large portions of its Illriyan and Lothorian conquests.\n\nAftersn forcing the pirates to terms of peace in favour of the Marians, Majorian would reach his crowning achievement, when an infuriated High-Khan Fiona Kerensky of Clan Wolf delivered a batchall via a large Marble slab dropped from orbit onto the emperor's palace. It is said that the slab very nearly killed the malevolent ruler when it destroyed his favourite bathroom, which he had been in just minutes before.\n\nMajorian accepted the High-Khans batchall and prepped himself for personal combat with the Khan and her second. While Majorian himself was a rather average mechwarrior, unfortunately for the Khan, Somaru, Majorian's second was one of the most skill mechwarriors to have ever been born. Somaru proceeded to decisively win the batchall. From here on out, few would challenge the now power drunk emperor. \n\nWhile elements of the MAF would eventually reclaim large portions of the the former Canopean territory, Majorian's Marian Hegemony remained cemented powers of the rimward Inner Sphere for many years to come.\n\nUnfortunately for the emperor himself, Majorians reign was cut short. After ruling the Hegemony for a grand total of 58 years, Majorian found himself slain by his second, as Somura seized power for himself, just after Majorian had finished teaching him everything he knew.",
