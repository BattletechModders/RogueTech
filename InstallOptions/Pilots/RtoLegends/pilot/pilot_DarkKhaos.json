    "Details": "Darkan K'Haos is one of Clan Ghost Bear's longest serving Khans in its history, earning the title at a young age, even for a clan warrior and living past the average life expectancy of the clan true born.\n\nIn typical Ghost Bear fashion, Darkan K'Haos is slow to anger and almost never makes a rash decision. Rather he has focused on building Ghost Bear into a formidable force, in hopes of one day invading the inner sphere.\n\nUnder the leadership of Darkan K'Haos, clan simulations have constantly shown that Ghost Bear would become a power rivaling even the strongest of the great houses in military might and territory should an invasion ever take place.",
