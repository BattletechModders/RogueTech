    "Details": "Dark Khaos is one of Clan Ghost Bear's longest serving khans in its history. Earning the title at a young age, even for a clan warrior and living past the average life expectancy of the clan true born.\n\nIn typical ghost bear fashion, Dark Khaos is slow to anger and almost never makes a rash decision. Rather he has focused on building ghost bear into a formidable force, in hopes of one day invading the inner sphere.\n\nUnder the leadership Dark Khaos, clan simulations have constantly shown that Ghost Bear would become a power rivaling even the strongest of the great houses in military might and territory should an invasion ever take place.",
