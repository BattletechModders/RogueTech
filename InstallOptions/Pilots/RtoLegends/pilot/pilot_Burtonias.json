    "FirstName": "Burtonias",
    "LastName": "Shaw",
    "Callsign": "St. Burt",
    "Gender": "Male",
    "Faction": "NoFaction",
    "Age": "46",
    "Details": "Occupying a rather odd place within the normally non-religious Clan Ghost Bear, Burtonias - or simply \"Burt\" - has a cult-like following within the Clan. Viewed as something of a deity, \"St. Burt\" - as he is often called - is prayed to for favor or succor in times of need by many within the Clan. While not officially recognized as a religion due to its un-Clanlike nature, many hold up Burt with a reverence similar to that of Nicolas Kerensky himself. So powerful is the cult of St. Burt, that it found itself a growing threat to more traditional religions within the Inner Sphere - especially those with similar cult-like behaviours - and uniting religious leaders in an attempt to stem its spread.\n\nBehind the veil of mystique, little history is known of the man himself. While it is assumed that he was born into the ranks of the Ghost Bear trueborn, no records of his early years exist and Clan genetic repositories have no samples of his DNA. Some records of questionable origin state he was born into a Clan Wolf sibko, which was then later absorbed into Clan Ghost Bear as the result of a Trial. It is worth noting, however, that Burt's most ardent devotees may become violent when questioned about such possibilities.\n\nWhatever his origin, what is for certain is that Burtonias rose amongst the ranks of the Clan Ghost Bear before attaining the title of SaKhan. Alongside his Khan, Dark Khaos, Burt worked relentlessly to expand the holdings of the Clan, transforming their Dominion from a middling power to a true behemoth within the Inner Sphere.\n\nThe specifics of how he earned the title \"Saint\", nor his cult following are presently unknown - it seems that the cult of Burt just appeared out of nowhere, fully formed.\n\nWith countless battlefield victories under his belt, Burt was a fierce adversary that few could match. This martial skill was matched by shrewd negotiating tactics uncommon to Clanners and he was often able to negotiate (albeit from a position of strength) territories without ever having to send his fellow Bears into battle.\n\nBurt was last seen during the battle of Asgard, on the capital world of Rasalhague, defending the city from Clan Cloud Cobra and the so-called \"Ghosts of Skye\". While presumed to have perished, records recovered from the wreckage of his 'Mech show that he managed to take down upwards of three Stars of Cloud Cobra 'Mechs before his own was destroyed. Post-battle salvage teams noted that while the majority of Burt's 'Mech had suffered catastrophic damage, the cockpit was relatively intact, albeit empty. The lack of any decisive evidence of the SaKhan's death has only added to his mystique, with some believing him to be alive today, decades after his last sighting.\n\nWhether alive or not, it is doubtless than many within Clan Ghost Bear continue to pray to St. Burt to grant them the strength of the bear, and the wisdom of the great father for generations to come.\n",
