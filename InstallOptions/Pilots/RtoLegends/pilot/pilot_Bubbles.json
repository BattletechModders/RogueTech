    "Details": "Little is known about the enigmatic being known as \"Mr. Bubbles\", only that references to her go back many centuries.\n\nAll seeing, ever present and slow to anger, some say Mr. Bubbles is nothing more than an urban myth, designed to scare mechwarriors and keep them in line. Others claim to she is a herald to an elder god known as the \"Server Overlord\" and that her appearance can mark either joy and laughter or signal doom. Descriptions of Mr. Bubbles consistently describe her as donning a great metal suit that resembles ancient diver outfits from over a millennium ago, only seen in museums on Terra, it is said that those who invoke her wrath find themselves shredded by a large and powerful drill-arm capable of tearing through even the hardest armors like butter. \n\nSome sources claim that the advanced, Star League era AI known as \"Roguebot\" is her pet and that she is capable of summoning minions known as voidlings to do her bidding. Others say she adores foxes and gives blessings to Clan Hell's Horses. The only concrete fact (if Mr. Bubbles even exists) is that she speaks an ancient terran language known as \"gifs\"",
