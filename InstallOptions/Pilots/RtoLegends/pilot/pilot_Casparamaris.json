    "Details": "Casparamaris represents perhaps one of the most bizarre chapters of history within the Inner-Sphere's long and storied annals. As with many things concerning Amaris and the fall of the Star-League, records concerning the origin of this rather unique drone are fragmented, incomplete and unlikely to ever be fully uncovered.\n\nWhat records do exist point to a break through in artificial intelligence just prior to Amaris' coup d’état.This break through would have allowed AI to be created with what was dubbed a 'personality' matrix that would have allowed the AI to emulate the individual the matrix was based on to a near indistinguishable degree. With these matrices were too large to be mounted on anything smaller than a capital warship, the SLDF envisioned the creation of specialty drone warships based on their most skilled naval commanders to command fleets of drone warships. This would have all but ensuring the SLDF's continued naval dominance.\n\nAfter the Amaris Coup, it seems that research and development on the system continued, and records make clear that at least one functional prototype based on the infamous M5 Caspar drone was created. Paranoid and self-absorbed to the extreme, it is perhaps not surprising that Amaris would see no personality more suitable for testing these new warships than his own. Thus was Casparamaris born.\n\nNo records in the Inner-Sphere tell of any actions or the fate of this 'Casparamaris' but it would seem that the unit survived not only the downfall of the Amaris Empire, but also the maelstrom of the early succession wars. With no recorded actions during these years, where Casparamaris was and what it was doing remain unanswered. What is known is that the drone warship made itself known to the house lords around the year 3047 when it appeared high in orbit around Harrow's Sun, annihilating a stunned Draconis Combine garrison in the name of the Federated Suns. After this Casparamaris would make regular appearances in systems under invasion offering its services to the highest bidder. Despite being a warship, with fully functional capital-scale weapons, Casparamaris would instead drop battlemechs onto the field equipped with some form of remote drone control, a technology that the Word of Blake would use to dramatic effect a few decades later, perhaps indicating this technology was far older than previously thought.\n\nBecoming a famed mercenary unit, it also became increasing clear that Casparamaris was searching for something, but what that something was remains unknown even to this day. What is known is that the unit's now ancient personality matrix was either starting to decay or the personality was becoming ever-more like the real Amaris, becoming somewhat obsessed with bibs and making near constant orders at the Golden Corral despite not requiring food.\n\nAfter turning hostile to everyone, elements of Comstar and various mercenary groups had enough and banded together and attacked the rogue drone, eventually crippling it. In a desperate attempt to escape the drone attempted to execute a blind jump, resulting in a spectacular explosion. This was the last time Casparamaris was spotted, yet in the aftermath of the explosion there was not enough debris to conclusively confirm the destruction of the drone. While most analysts in Comstar state the rogue warship was destroyed pointing to the huge drop in unconfirmed sightings and destruction of supply convoys, others point to the fact that Casparamaris once went over two hundred years without being sighted or known about suggesting the AI may once again have changed how it was operating.\n\nNaturally, there are many questions surrounding Casparamaris, Where was the drone warship for over 200 years between end of the Star-League and what was it doing? What caused the drone to suddenly return? Why did it turn on everyone? What was it searching for? was it acting alone or was it under control of a yet unknown actor? What was it doing with all the bibs and food it recieved from the Golden Corral?\n\nSome believe that the answers to at least some of these questions might be found in the secret archives of Aleksandr Kerensky and his son Nicholas, but Clan Wolf outright refuses to even confirm if such documents are in their possession, let alone the contents to any such material. If any such documents do exist, perhaps they hold the answer to the most burning questions, was there more a single prototype constructed? and if so, how many others are out there, still functioning?\n",
