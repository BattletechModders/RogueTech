    "Details": "Born on Royal Foxx to an influential Canopian family, DeVega grew up in a privileged environment and luxury of extremes for the Periphery nation. Unfortunately, like most of his peers, DeVega let this fortune go to his head and fill him with privileged ideas and plans, none of which would come to pass.\n\n\nEnrolling in the best academies that money and prestige could buy didn't matter. The Star League fell, and the wars that occurred leading to that claimed his family before seeing him join the SLDF for vengeance upon Amaris for what his schemes caused.\n\n\nWhat was surprising, was DeVega's ability in point blank mech brawling. Quickly rising to command a company, the numerous city fights saw him taking his signature Black Knight into brutal close range combat.\n\n\nWhen the war ended and the SLDF left, DeVega went with them. With no home to return to, he joined the Exodus and left the Inner Sphere behind, he assumed for a new life. But even in Exile, the SLDF faced war, so once more, he left a home behind.\n\n\nThe Clans were where he finally settled. joining Clan Wolf he earned the position of Star Colonel during the initial Trials, and after the Founder disappeared he was chosen to be Khan. Viewing people as one of their most valuable resources, it was not long before he came into conflict with other Clans, resulting first in a victorious absorption of Smoke Jaguar, then yet another Exodus, this time back to the Inner Sphere.\n\n\nWith several colonial territories established, Clan Wolf fought in war after war, and numerous Trials. Making allies and enemies alike, Clan Wolf under his leadership flourished, culminating in a climactic Trial of Possession for Terra itself. A Trial that saw the Wolf once again the victors, and his taking the title of ilKhan.",
