    "Details": "Once serving as the Chancellor of the Capellan Confederation, Slippy was eventually driven mad by an Aurigan Coalition seizure of his personal salt mine. After being driven out of the confederation after he attempted to nuke the system of Capella, the now mad ex-chancellor eventually wound up being installed as the Director of the Aurigan Directorate. Between his constant dressing up in costumes of toads, mad ravings about becoming the First Lord of a 3rd Star League and his delusions of having razed terra with Directorate forces, the stark-raving mad Director has also found time to found a so-called news agency. What passes for news from this agency comes in the form of random nonsense and misinformation, however, it seems that perhaps there is some truth behind at least some of these words as Slippy has found himself to be relentlessy hunted by INN 'Fact-Checker' teams with orders to take down the insane Director.",
