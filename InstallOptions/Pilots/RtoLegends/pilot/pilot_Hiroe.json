    "Details": "Jameson \"Hiroe\" Davion was one of the Federated Suns longest serving and most memorable First Princes. Like most of Davion's former First Princes, Hiroe was a subscriber of solving most problems by adding more auto-cannons and when in doubt, blame Kurita.\n\nAs with other successor lords of the era, Hiroe went along with McDookie's attempts to form the '3rd Star League'. Though the attempt ended in disaster, Hiroe managed to keep Davion afloat and despite losing alot of ground, ended his reign with more territory than he had lost.\n\nIt was said that Hiroe once had a nightmare where the Lyrans had been overwhelmed by pirates, the Combine destroyed by vikings, the FWL destroyed by sharks and cats and Comstar and the Confederation buried under the many feet of a swarm of burrocks, leaving only House Davion standing and finally settling the question of first lordship. Sadly Hiroe found he could not hope to claim that prize because of the threat of burrocks and bulls at this doorstep.",
