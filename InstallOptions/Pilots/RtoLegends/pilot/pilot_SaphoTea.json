    "Details": "While most well-known names within Clan society are those of great warriors, there are a select few whose names shine amongst these stars that are not. One such name is that of Rime Lynn, the first IlChi of Clan Stone Lion.\n\nBorn into Clan Hell's Horses as a freeborn, Rime's station all but ensured he would never receive the training or resources to become one of the Clan's great warriors. While talented enough to earn himself a spot within the Clan's touman as a tanker, he was never destined to journey with the Clan's trueborn warriors on their conquest of the Inner Sphere.\n\nFortunately for Rime, this meant he was spared from Clan Hell's Horses' exile from their homeworlds following the War of Reaving. With the Horses now abjured, Rime was part of the homeworld remnants of the Clan that was re-organized into the newly formed Clan Stone Lion.\n\nWhile most derided the new Clan as a pawn of the Star Adders, Rime was determined to change this notion. With his Clan in desperate need of warriors, Rime found himself pressed into front line forces. Able to hold his own, he made a name for himself with his ability to bring his Clan together, and soon found himself being looked up to by several trueborn warriors after helping them deal with the loss of their former Clan identity.\n\nIn June 3080, Rime had a chance encounter with the soon-to-be khan of Clan Coyote, Han Hill during a Trial. During that Trial he left an impression on Hill, sparking renewed communication between the two Clans. Little did Rime know at the time just how impactful this encounter would be on his future.\n\nAs communication between the two Clans continued, Rime found himself pressed more and more into the role of chief liaison with Clan Coyote, a position in which he excelled. As relations between the two Clans improved, the overall perception of Clan Stone Lion improved with them. In recognition of Rime's work, and hoping to further improve the standing of the Clan, the Stone Lion Khan made the decision to revive the long forsaken role of \"IlChi\" and award the position to Rime.\n\nDespite some complaints from the trueborn warriors, most recognized Rime was perfect for the role and, perhaps unsurprisingly, he excelled at it.\n\nOver the course of the next several years, Rime succeeded in re-making the image of Clan Stone Lion, bringing the Clan close with the other Clans in the Kerensky Cluster, with the sole exception of Clan Blood Spirit. Under Rime's tutelage several other Clans revived the office of the IlChi and he became a name known to nearly all the Clan warrior castes.\n\nBy the time of his death, Rime Lynn was widely credited for making Clan Stone Lion an accepted part of Clan society, which greatly assisted his Khan's military victories and efforts to expand his Clan's influence in the Kerensky Cluster. His peerless work truly showed even the most stubborn trueborn warrior the value of a PR campaign and setting a new standard for cooperation between Clans.",
