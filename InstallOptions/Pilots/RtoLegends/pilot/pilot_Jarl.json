    "Details": "Jarl Jarlson is an oddity amongst the JarnFolk. Not a member of any large family, nor can his lineage be traced to any known member of the Jarlson family. Several outsiders have noted he bears a striking resemblance to the missing Carl Marik, a distant cousin of Corrine. Naturally Jarl has denied any such connection and strangely enough all those who have raised this issue have disappeared or been found dead.\n\nWhatever his origin, Jarl was a natural leader amongst the JarnFolk and together with Figing, he helped shape their military doctrine. A favoured tactic of Jarl was loading 'lutefisk' into his mortar launchers and dropping them on his enemies, both confusing his opponents and covering their cockpit and sensors, effectively blinding them.\n\nLike Figing, Jarl dreamed of turning the JarnFolk into a clan and it is said that he had a plan to do so, even if he was never able to enact it. Ultimately, Jarl retired to the world of Goat Path and proceeded to start a business selling goat's milk to the Lyrans in finely crafted wooden bottles, against all odds it was an overnight success.\n",
