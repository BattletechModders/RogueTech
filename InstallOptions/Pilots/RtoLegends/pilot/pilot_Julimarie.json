    "Details": "The daughter of Trex \"Kamea\" Arano, Julimarie Arano grew up in the waning years of the Coalition's efforts to rebuild the Aurigan Reach following its brutal civil war. As the nation reached its near-golden age, Trex began to slowly integrate Julimarie into the everyday running of the nation.\n\nIn this way, Julimarie was groomed from a relatively young age to be a successor to her mother. As Trex reached her senior years, she passed the reigns of leadership to her daughter, now a very experienced figure in her own right and in her prime.\n\nUnfortunately for Juli, her reign would quickly turn from a golden age into one of conflict and devastation as a new cycle of war rippled through the Inner Sphere and Periphery. Before her reign was more than three years old, the Taurian Concordat swiftly and brutally invaded the Reach. With the aid of elite mercenary units, the Coalition forces were routed time and time again, and in short order Julimarie was forced into hiding with what remained of the nation's military.\n\nFor the next 4 years, Julimarie worked in secret, evading Taurian patrols and preparing for a guerrilla-style campaign to reclaim her beloved nation. Eventually, having gathered her strength, Julimarie launched herself into the fray into a quest to reclaim her nation, just like her grandmother before her. \n\nTaking the Taurians by relative surprise, Julimarie was able to rapidly re-secure most of the worlds of the Coalition in fairly short order, capturing huge amounts of Taurian war materiel in the process. Seeking to punish the Taurians for their betrayal, Julimarie ordered the annexation of several Taurian worlds before the Taurians sued for peace.\n\nThe next several years were relatively peaceful for the fragile nation, but Julimarie continued her military build-up, determined to break the cycle of war that had repeatedly torn her nation apart. When given the chance to join the so-called new 'Star League', Julimarie jumped at the chance and allied herself to ComStar and the recently arrived Clan Coyote. Launching an assault on the Federated Suns, the Aurigans were met with great success and eventually doubled their size by absorbing some key Davion worlds before the flames of war were slowly put out across the Sphere.\n\nFor the rest of her reign, peace was maintained and the nation prospered in ways a Periphery nation could rarely dream of, thanks to the advanced technologies they were able to access from their allies. However, the military might of the nation was drained, with little chance of a quick re-build as neither ComStar nor the Coyotes would provide advanced military hardware.\n\nTowards the end of her reign, the friction of dealing with the alien culture of Clan society began to rise ever-higher and Julimarie began to wonder if allowing the Coyotes into the Rimward-Periphery was a mistake or not. Leaving the throne to her daughter, Julimarie watched the so-called 'Star League' alliance collapse in her final years, just like all previous leagues. On her deathbed she predicted that conflict with the Coyotes would come as the previous allies found themselves, increasingly, on different sides of the rising tensions in the Sphere. Julimarie however took comfort in knowing her daughter would guide the coalition through the coming storm.\n",
