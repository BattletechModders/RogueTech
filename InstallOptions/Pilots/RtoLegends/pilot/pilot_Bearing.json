    "Details": "A former Khan of Clan Star Adder, Bearing oversaw the clan's expansion from a relatively minor clan, into a power house within the Kerensky cluster. Although not able to translate that success into his attempts to claim territory within the Inner Sphere, Bearing none the less became one of the clan's most respected khans. A fierce military leader, Bearing was also well known for his knowledge of LosTech, even amongst the clans. Although clan records also record his dislike of advanced Star-League Era AI, including his relentless attempts to torture such an AI, known only as 'RogueBot'.",
