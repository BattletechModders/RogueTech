At the sound of your name, you turn to see [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] approaching, \"Commander {COMMANDER.FirstName} {COMMANDER.LastName}, you requested my presence, quiaff?\"\r\n\r\n\"Welcome to the bridge, [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]].  We have arrived at <i>{TGT_SYSTEM.Name}</i>.  Sumire will need to know the coordinates of where we will be dropping.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aff, Commander {COMMANDER.FirstName} {COMMANDER.LastName}.  The area that needs to be scanned is 82.8628\u00B0 S, 135.0000\u00B0 E.  There should be an entrance to an underground facilty that will show up on your topography scans.\" [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] responds.\r\n\r\nOne of the techs calls out, \"Commander, I've located the facility, but scans are showing considerable damage to the entrance to the structure.\"\r\n\r\nBoth you and [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] shout at the same time, \"PUT IT ON THE MAIN SCREEN NOW.\"\r\n\r\nThe main viewscreen switches from the orbital view to a mountain ravine with a plume of thick black smoke spiralling into the clear sky.  You notice [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] start to issue an order, but then close {TGT_MW.Det} mouth, obviously not wanting to overstep {TGT_MW.Det} bounds again.  \"Increase magnification by 10,\" you call out.\r\n\r\nThe image zooms in, and you can clearly see that the facility has been attacked, with sufficient force to destroy the reinforced doors and allow egress inside.  You point at an area to the east of the smoking entrance, \"There, focus on that area.\"\r\n\r\nThe tech repositions the camera and zooms in to maximum.  Everyone can make out the obvoius signs of a departing convoy, but landscape doesn't allow for any more information as the terrain obscures the viewing angle.\r\n\r\nDarius moves over to where you are standing, \"What are your orders, Commander?\"",

Also inform them of our intent to initiate a combat drop on that base.  We don't need them coming to the <i>rescue</i> of these bandits because they think we are invading.\"\r\n\r\nDarius quickly fires off a message to the Planetary Government.  It doesn't take long before a <i>ping</i> sounds on the termnial indicating an incoming message, \"Commander, the Attache says you are cleared to engage.  More to the point, the Planetary Government has been searching for this band of bandits for some time, and are officially posting a contract for their base to be captured.\"\r\n\r\nYou digest this information, \"Why haven't they been able to find them?  It literally took us no time at all.\"\r\n\r\nDarius continues to review the information in the message, \"Apparently, the facility in question was marked as <i>completely destroyed by earthquake</i> in their database so the region was never properly investigated.\"\r\n\r\nYou shrug, \"Oh well, better for us then.  Nothing like getting paid to retrieve your own property.\"\r\n\r\n[[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] steps forward, \"Commander, I will take my leave now and head to the MechBay.  You will need me to retreive <i>Khaos Theory</i>.\"\r\n\r\nYou turn towards [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]], \"Your value to this company has never been in question and you can participate in the attack, but the astechs will secure your mech and bring it back to the <i>Argo</i>.  We need to ensure it has not been tampered with.\"\r\n\r\n[[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] holds back a retort and instead calmly responds, \"Aff, Commander.  I feel I must also inform you that <i>Khaos Theory</i> is locked with a neurofeedback system keyed to my brainwaves.  No one other than myself can pilot her.  Even in maintenance mode, the weapons will be offline and it will only travel 50m before shutting down for 12 hours.\"\r\n\r\nYou nod your head, \"Understood.  I'll instruct the astechs to contact you if things don't go smoothly getting your mech onto the <i>Leopard</i>.\"\r\n\r\n<color=#FF0000>CAPTURE BASE CONTRACT: KHAOS THEORY, ADDED TO COMMAND CENTER</color>",
