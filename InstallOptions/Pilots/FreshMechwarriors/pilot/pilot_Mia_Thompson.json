Mia as a 12 year old child, climbed into her fathers Agromech, (a Cattlemaster used for farming) and fought off the pirates alone for over an hour before help arrived. After that she was drafter and raised in the military. Her natural talent and understanding has seen her quickly rise through the ranks as a respected mechwarrior. These days however she prefers to choose her own path and left Steiner after her last campaign.   \n\n ",
