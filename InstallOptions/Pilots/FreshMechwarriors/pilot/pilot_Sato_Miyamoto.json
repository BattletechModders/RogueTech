    "Details": "Sato Miyamoto honors sacrifice, hard-work and the ancient principles of Kuritan Bushido, above all else. Nicknamed the \"Scorpion\", he carefully calculates his trajectories and poises to strike, just as volleys of ammunition are launched with perfect precision, usually killing the pilot or his crew leaving major portions of opposing vehicles and battlemechs in tact. for there is no greater honor than reaping pristine weapons for one's Warlord in the DMCS. Tai-shos prize Miyamoto's perseverance and dedication to his craft, leading to various incentivized bonuses for such elegantly clean kills. <b><color=#00ffff>Can Pilot Mechs Only.</color></b> \n\n ",
