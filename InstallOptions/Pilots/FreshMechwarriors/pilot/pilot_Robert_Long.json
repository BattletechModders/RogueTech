    "Details": "Little is known about Robert Long apart from his callsign, \"Streak\". Rumors speak of a tragic past or painful circumstance that leads him to prepare in the most complete manner possible prior to entering battle. Nonetheless, no stone is left unturned to the point of being intolerable to most company XO's. Long values data and information above else, believing it to be the reason he has lived through every encounter he's come across, so far... He disdains employers and superiors with little regard for knowledge and frequently surprises his coworkers with revelations of incoming enemy reinforcements, well before any probe sensors say otherwise. <b><color=#00ffff>Can Command Tanks and Pilot Mechs.</color></b> \n\n ",
