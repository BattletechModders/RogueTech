However, as their paths diverged, Amanda's bold and daring tactics led her to embrace the callsign \"Firefly\", while Julia, with her graceful and protective nature, adopted \"Angel\". Despite choosing separate careers, the sisters hold an unbreakable bond, and whenever they cross paths on the battlefield, a shimmer of kinship lights up the darkest moments of war.. \n\n ",
