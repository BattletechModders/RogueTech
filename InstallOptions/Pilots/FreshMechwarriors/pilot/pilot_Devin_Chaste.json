After finally receiving his discharge paperwork for a decorated career in service, he used his connections, along with his pension, to escape into mercenary life. Bugaboo has since proven himself a respectable addition to any mercenary company looking for a lance leader capable of coordinating tactical alpha strikes to the his employer's enemies.\n\n",
