    "Details": " Christina Wolf, known as \"Frostmark\", was born amidst the icy expanse of her home planet Ryde, a world veiled in perpetual snow and frigid winds. Raised within a secluded outpost on the frozen tundra, she discovered an innate connection with the towering BattleMechs that patrolled the white plains, becoming captivated by their cold steel grace. Embracing her calling, she underwent rigorous training under the watchful eye of a weathered MechWarrior mentor. With a bright blue eye marked by a fierce scar, Christina earned her callsign \"Frostmark\", a testament to both her icy homeworld and the indomitable spirit etched into her very being. On the battlefield, she is a born leader and can lead a lance through blizzards and low visibility like a guiding beacon, her Mech is like an extension of her soul. Yet, beneath her icey exterior, a glimmer of warmth remains. \n\n ",
