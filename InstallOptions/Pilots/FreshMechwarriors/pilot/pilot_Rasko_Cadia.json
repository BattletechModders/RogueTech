How Rasko Cadia lived to see his fortieth birthday was a wonder to all who've seen his penchant for fireworks on display. Demo has an almost uncanny ability to recite all the ingredients in most explosives throughout the known Inner Sphere. He brings an almost child-like glee in watching the parts of opposing Battlemechs come apart in a dizzying array of chemical combustions and delights. He spends his time afterwards recreating the exact point or cause of detonation to further increase his available methods of destruction.\n\n ",
