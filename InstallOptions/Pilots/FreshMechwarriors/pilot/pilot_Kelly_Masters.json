    "Details": " Kelly Masters, callsign \"Dream\", is an extraordinary MechWarrior with an unprecedented story. A former scientist at an experimental weapons facility, she faced a life-altering accident that changed the course of her existence. During an ill-fated experiment, she was exposed to a potent energy source, leaving her trapped in a glowing blue energy form that defies comprehension. Forced to rely on a specialized containment suit to survive, Kelly now lives as a living entity of raw energy, forgoing the need for sleep or sustenance. After the catastrophic event, the unscrupulous corporation she worked for sought to exploit her newfound abilities. Confined within their research facility, Kelly endured years of captivity, her life reduced to endless experiments and observation. However, fate smiled upon her when a mercenary company of MechWarriors attacked the facility, seeking to disrupt the corporation's sinister schemes. In the chaos of battle, Kelly saw a glimmer of hope and seized the opportunity to break free from her captivity. The mercenaries, astonished by her extraordinary powers, offered her a chance for a new life among them.  \n\n ",
