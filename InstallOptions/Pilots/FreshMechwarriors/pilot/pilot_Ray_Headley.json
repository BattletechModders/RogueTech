He's best known as the Star Gladiator for the Golden Suns, a Solaris team with an impressively high record of coring out Mech engines. He unceremoniously earned his nickname when, during a match against an opposing team of Urbanmechs, a bump on the cockpit of his Firestarter, dislodged the Mechwarrior from his seat right into his good luck trophy. The object slammed between him and the cockpit, opening mic channels, breaking his communications relay as he yelled out to world, those infamous words, \"...Thank God, I remembered my Jockstrap!\"\n\n ",
