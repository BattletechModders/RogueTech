    "Details": "Rob Werner, callsign \"Toga\", lacks finesse in the finer aspects of war, but more than makes up for it sheer brutality. Often seen charging headfirst into the enemy line, Toga revels in flanking the enemy backline and having his way with the rear and side armor of long-range artillery units. He paints his trademark green striped camouflage, Omega Toga Pattern, on his 'Mechs, which he believes is the key to successfully fooling opponent. To his foes, it's as if he just springs up from around them, seemingly out of thin air, preceding the blood-curdling screams which in turn are followed by complete radio silence.\n\n",
