Raised in the secretive enclaves of a clandestine tech guild, Ava's fascination with machines bordered on the obsessive.  Gifted with an uncanny knack for deciphering the arcane secrets of BattleMechs, she earned the evocative callsign \"Flux\" for her ability to manipulate the ebb and flow of combat like a cosmic choreographer. With her enigmatic skills, Ava has goals that transcend mere battlefield glory, she seeks to uncover the long-lost mysteries of the ancient WarTech, a journey that may one day reshape the power balance of the sector. \n\n ",
