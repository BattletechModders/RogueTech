    "Details": "Mr. Lee Williams, best known by his, callsign \"Rustler\" is used to hunting down the snakes that dared to desert Capellan armies. The Confederacy suffers no cowards and none live that openly concede to betraying such an allegiance, lest they feel the stinging snake bite of one of Lee's poisoned skinning knives.  His unwavering allegiance once he commits to a job has had a considerable effect on those willing to put him on a payroll, as he will pursue fleeing Mechwarriors until they are nothing more than a smoldering ruin on the Battlefield. He slices verticle lines on portions of his body with scars denoting his victims, past, present and future.   <b><color=#00ffff>Can Pilot Mechs Only.</color></b> \n\n ",
