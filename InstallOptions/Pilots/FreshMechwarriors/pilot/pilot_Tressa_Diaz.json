    "Details": "Often caught staring into space, Tressa Diaz, callsign \"Trance\" spends most of her downtime listening to old Terran electronic dance music. She is often found preparing her cockpit or sitting on a dropship long before an engagment eagerly playing out the dance of battle in her mind, sweeping notes of autocannon fire, searing particle cannons and rockets hammering in to the side of enemy torsos. She never seems phased during an engagement, a possible side effect of the hallucinogenics she regularly consumes to better \"feel\" the vibes of war.\n\n",
