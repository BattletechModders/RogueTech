    "Details": " Igor Teschan is an interesting case. Rumor is he was betrayed by a member of his pirate crew on the surface of Senorbi. He never talks about the incident but the the rumor is bad enough. Apparently a pirate mechwarrior who goes by the callsign \"Matador\" blindsided him with a ferocious alpha strike from a tricked out firestarter. Igor was unable to eject due to his pre sabotaged eject system. These days Igor is rarely seen out of his Neurosynaptic Interface Suit (NSI). he is heavily scarred and his eyes have been replaced with cybernetics giving them a cold red glow. Now he spends his days with a laser focus, sharpening his Mechwarrior skills in the hope that one day he might run into an old friend... \n\n ",
