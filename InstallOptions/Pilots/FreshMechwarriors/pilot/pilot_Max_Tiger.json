    "Details": "Max Tiger, is an oddity, little is known of his background as he never really talks much, unless its old war stories. He lives for the thrill of battle and thrives in the cockpit. When it comes to mechs his perspective is the bigger the better. Tiger is only ever happy when hes pushing his mech to its limits. Outside of combat he always seems restless, constantly eager for the next fight, and the next epic story.  \n\n ",
