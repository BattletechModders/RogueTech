Life on the coastal bandit worlds of Periphery were a constant battle for survival and he quickly found he had a penchant for destruction. It wasn't until he joined the Pirate Organization, \"Blackguards of Tortuga\" did Tao become acquianted with his soon-to-be lackey, \"Tick\", a nervous wreck of a pirate that seemed to somehow restrain Xu's wanton violence enough for him to earn a decent wage and be able to \"preserve\" some treasure from the remains littering the battlefield. <b><color=#00ffff>Can Command Tanks and Pilot Mechs.</color></b> \n\n ",
