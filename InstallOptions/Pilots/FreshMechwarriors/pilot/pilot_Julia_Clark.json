They were both later trained at the renowned Blackstar Academy, becoming highly skilled MechWarriors.  Julia's elegant finesse and innate protective nature earned her the moniker \"Angel\".  While her sisters firey nature and daring approach earned her the callsign \"Firefly\".  A falling out over the morality of a complex mission caused the sisters to go their seperate ways. However, they still hold an unbreakable bond, maybe one day they will be reconcile. \n\n ",
