    "Details": "Sydney Graves, or Lady \"Blackthorn\", as so-named by her war patron, Matron Denescia of House Arano, wasn't like most of her peers. She quickly gained notoriety as the most efficient sniper during her tenure at the Royal Academy of Gavel, located somewhere between the Inner Sphere worlds and the Rimward Periphery. Her hand to hand combat is very sharp, most sparring partnes are left in pain after being partnered up for training, denoting her namesake. She struggled for years with having to balance the royal machinations of her minor house and her longing for personal freedom. Until the day she managed to hotwire her family's ancestral battlemech, leaving everything behind and swearing to live up to her ancestor's legacy, famous explorers of the far reaches of the inner sphere and conquerors of worlds.  <b><color=#00ffff>Can Pilot Mechs Only.</color></b> \n\n ",
