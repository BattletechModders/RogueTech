It would be well-protected with twelve and a half tons of armor and use specialized missile racks which could carry diverse types of advanced missiles. Over years of testing and field exercises the Bombardier proved itself extremely effective at fulfilling the long-range fire support role, easily surpassing its vehicular counterparts and even inspiring talks of disbanding the SLDF's artillery arm once enough Bombardiers were operational.",
