This mission profile included attacking Mobile Headquarters, field bases and command level officers. Rather than be part of the standard formation, Exterminators were attached to a regimental or higher headquarters unit, often as a fifth member of the command lance itself, before being assigned to individual units.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Nimble</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.17</color></b>",
