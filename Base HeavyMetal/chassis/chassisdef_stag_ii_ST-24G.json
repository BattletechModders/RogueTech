Additionally, Ferro-Fibrous weave was incorporated into the armor, though at an overall decrease in protection. The SRMs were removed in favor of an additional Medium Laser, two Medium Pulse Lasers, and two Small Lasers.[2] This gave the 'Mech greater battlefield longevity, though the potential for excessive heat buildup was much greater.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Narrow/Low Profile</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.03</color></b>",
