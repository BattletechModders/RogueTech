  "Name": "Blazer Laser Pistol",
  "Details": "The Blazer Laser Pistol is a pistol version of the popular Blazer Laser Rifle. Resembling a sawed-off shotgun, it utilizes the same twin laser tube design as the rifle, providing the same devastating firepower in a much smaller package. This has also resulted in the pistol being outlawed on many Inner Sphere worlds. Two power packs provide enough energy for five shots, although the barrels can be fired separately, in which case the Blazer functions like a standard Laser Pistol.",
