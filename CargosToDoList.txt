TT superheavy vehicles have six+ hit locations. How did we convert and is that best? especially with regard to Redbat's tool - They get the total armor and structure they would have with six+ locations, concentrated on five.

Rewrite all of AMS trait descriptions.

Rebalance AMS

Fix MC Duel contract's spawning too much.

Flamers need bonus vs PA.
    Waiting on Kmission for to-hit modifier that can be put on weapons.

Make sure an Explodium trait is on every damage on jam weapon

Figure out and do things with Target Acquisition

Vultures are too small? Stormcrows possibly too big.

Disorderly Withdrawl
    If you don't get to the evac Sumire says she won't be able to pick you up for another X rounds. This is not true, the zone remains active.
    You can keep re-clicking Withdraw even after it changes to say "In X Rounds" and it will reset the timer each time.
    Does the actual zone on map have anything to do with the delay sumire talks about?
    Is MC and DW conflicting?
    What exactly is going on???

Check TAG and NARC stacking, what should stack what shouldn't and how will the player know.

Reworded objectives could make a Destroy Base or Rescue where *not* destroying the enemy units was a goal. Strongly negative cash for killing the lance. Forcing players to do the primary and extract

Shakedown by port authority event

What's up with the custom mechs in FP Fighting Ghosts?

We have a prefab for the Union dropship. it could be used in contracts as a building/turret.
