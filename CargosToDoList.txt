Cargo's Note List

Suggest randomly spawned mines on roads in non-city contracts.

Fix MC Duel contract's spawning too much.

Check vehicles with Redbat's tool,

Make sure an Explodium trait is on every damage on jam weapon

Revision pass on Pirate weapons

Orion X has wrong description

Do APCs need unit_lance tags?

Finish my Flashpoint

Build second try event for White Whale

Increase cash bonuses from contract secondary objectives. - Escort, Defend, Ambush, Destroy Base,  done

Does Tanker defender trait do anything? what's up with guarded/entrenched and vehicles?

Work on VTOL List <--- Slightly deprecated while Raza is in a vee making mood

Implement VTOL external hardpoints with movement debuff
    Bomb packs so they can have more than 1 without dropping them all at once.

Figure out and do things with Attack/Defend
    Make Scorpion's Nest

Figure out and do things with Target Acquisition

Vultures are too small? Stormcrows possibly too big.

Disorderly Withdrawl
    If you don't get to the evac Sumire says she won't be able to pick you up for another X rounds. This is not true, the zone remains active.
    You can keep re-clicking Withdraw even after it changes to say "In X Rounds" and it will reset the timer each time.
    Does the actual zone on map have anything to do with the delay sumire talks about?
    Is MC and DW conflicting?
    What exactly is going on???

Check TAG and NARC stacking, what should stack what shouldn't and how will the player know.

Reworded objectives could make a Destroy Base or Rescue where *not* destroying the enemy units was a goal. Strongly negative cash for killing the lance. Forcing players to do the primary and extract

Shakedown by port authority event

We have a prefab for the Union dropship. it could be used in contracts as a building/turret.

Reputation effects on contract objectives.

The Arano mission with the APCs coming to take the base might be too hard.

Update Freeman Commando

Make duel lance set so littlefriends and smol vehicles aren't in duoduels

VTOL Jet booster is just copied supercharger, isn't like TT version

More traits for TAC info?

Harjel OP, repairs fully and players abuse by just passing turns. Repairs are neatly instant in battle vs having to pay time and days out. Broken.
