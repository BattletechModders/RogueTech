Rewrite all of AMS trait descriptions.

Rebalance AMS

Fix MC Duel contract's spawning too much.

Flamers need bonus vs PA.
    Waiting on Kmission for to-hit modifier that can be put on weapons.
    Added To-Hit to Heavy Flamer ammos for now.

Check vehicles with Redbat's tool,

Make sure an Explodium trait is on every damage on jam weapon

Revision pass on Pirate weapons

Fix Freeman Commando, conflict with UAV slot changes, fixed stealth values need check.

Balance pass on CaptureEscort_GrandTheftAuto_Alt because it drops a guaranteed Assault lance, and can spawn at low skulls.

Orion X has wrong description

Do APCs need unit_lance tags?

Finish my Flashpoint

Build second try event for White Whale

Learn how MC lances work
    Build some that aren't indirect fire support

Does Tanker defender trait do anything? what's up with guarded/entrenched and vehicles?

Work on VTOL List <--- Slightly deprecated while Raza is in a vee making mood

Implement VTOL external hardpoints with movement debuff

Figure out and do things with Attack/Defend
    Make Scorpion's Nest

Figure out and do things with Target Acquisition

Vultures are too small? Stormcrows possibly too big.

Still some unessasary LRM hotloading occasionally. Weirdly might be isolated to LRM variant Scorpions.

Disorderly Withdrawl
    If you don't get to the evac Sumire says she won't be able to pick you up for another X rounds. This is not true, the zone remains active.
    You can keep re-clicking Withdraw even after it changes to say "In X Rounds" and it will reset the timer each time.
    Does the actual zone on map have anything to do with the delay sumire talks about?
    Is MC and DW conflicting?
    What exactly is going on???

Check TAG and NARC stacking, what should stack what shouldn't and how will the player know.

TT superheavy vehicles have six+ hit locations. How did we convert and is that best? especially with regard to Redbat's tool
