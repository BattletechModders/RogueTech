Cargo's Note List

~9 HBSBT damage per kilogram of TNT equivilent 

Arty shell aprox damage calc theory:

1000/[shots per ton]/2/3*9, half propellent half charge, 30% of force heads toward nearby object, 9 upconversion as above.

1000/shots*1.5=AOE damage

works for Thumper. Either sniper/longtom ammo per ton or damage is wrong.

Transport helicopters are operated in assault, medium and heavy classes. 
Air assault helicopters are usually the smallest of the transport types, and designed to move an infantry squad or section and their equipment. 
Helicopters in the assault role are generally armed for self-protection both in transit and for suppression of the landing zone

Prototype Heatsinks add 1% critical hit taken chance malus per?
    Any other Prototype gear for that matter.

Copypasta in vehicle fluff

Trim Vehicle names.

Tune what spawns in B-Team type missions.

Spall Liner to upgrade or specialist slot item; take 1 slot in each location like stealth?

Allies not returning to follow mode!!!
    Should allies be in Blackout considering their fairly frequent issues with travel?

More Arty shells
    Missing utility: flare and smoke
    Cluster bombs with submunitions
    FAE shells

VTOL Cluster Bombs should use HasShells

Remake Scorpion's Nest with MC lance size function.

Make more Warthog VTOLs. LBX20? SBG?

Make Flare mortar rounds apply a design mask like smoke. Everything in it is more visible

Replace Exponent evasion pips algebra problem traits with statements of effect. eg. 
    "{0} Recoil Per Evasion Pip" vs "Recoil Change based on your evasion. Base Recoil multiplied by: Number of Evasion Pips to the power of {0}",
    This is mostly straightforward, Heavy Gauss is 1 recoil per pip for example. Some weirdness with select fire weapons like RAC.
    
Make sure an Explodium trait is on every damage on jam weapon

Orion X has wrong description

Do APCs need unit_lance tags?

Does Tanker defender trait do anything? what's up with guarded/entrenched and vehicles?

Work on VTOL List

Figure out and do things with Target Acquisition

Vultures are too small? Stormcrows possibly too big.

Check TAG and NARC stacking, what should stack what shouldn't and how will the player know.

Reworded objectives could make a Destroy Base or Rescue where *not* destroying the enemy units was a goal. Strongly negative cash for killing the lance. Forcing players to do the primary and extract

Shakedown by port authority event

Amputation and cyber limb events

We have a prefab for the Union dropship. it could be used in contracts as a building/turret.
