    "Details": "The Turhan was first built for the Terran Hegemony in 2530 by Dieron's Buhallin Military Products. The company, known for its wheeled vehicles, built the Turhan to answer the HAF's need for an urban assault vehicle to support its infantry in urban environments. The vehicle acted as an Armored Personnel Carrier, deploying troops from its large infantry transport bay. The vehicle is protected by seven and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor, which ensured its cargo arrived at the designation intact. The Turhan's principal weaponry was its twin Large Lasers which were mounted in its turret. Mounted with the lasers were a pair of Machine Guns.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 5/8 Hex: 150/240 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<b>Armor:</b> Armor\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       247     25\n<b>Left</b>         140     25\n<b>Right</b>       140     25\n<b>Rear</b>         90     25\n<b>Turret</b>      155     25\n\n<b>Total</b>      772    125\n",
