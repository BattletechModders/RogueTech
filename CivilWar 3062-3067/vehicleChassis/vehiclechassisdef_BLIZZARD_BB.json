    "Details": "The Blizzard Hover Transport was designed by Kressly Warworks and was first produced in 3054. While the Blizzard was intended for use against the Clans, it gained notoriety in the Chaos March and its effectiveness was realized in the Capellan-St. Ives War. This variant dates to the late 3060s and is intended to be an escort for other Blizzards. It lacks the infantry bay and upgrades the armor protection utilizing Ferro-Fibrous technology. Instead of the LRM, the Black Blizzard mounts pairs of SRM-4s and Machine Guns in the turret. It also includes a Guardian ECM Suite to protect the unit from enemy electronics.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Hover: Fast on open ground and water, slow in rough terrain, not very agile.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>ICE: Air breathing Combustion Engine.
