    "Details": "The Main Gauche Light Support Tank is a fire support companion to Brooks Incorporated's Galleon. Though slower, topping out at only 64 km/h, five tons of armor protect it. The Main Gauche was actually submitted to the Free Worlds League Military because that organization was looking for a tank with long range capability. It finally reached full production in 3064. The main gun of the Main Gauche is an Imperator Type II Light Gauss Rifle, a weapon that has an incredible range. The single magazine carries a ton of ammunition. In order to mount this, however, the tank forgoes speed, armor, a turret, and close-range weaponry. Its only backup is a pair of Voelkers Machine Guns, which are only a credible threat to unarmored infantry.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 4/6 Hex: 120/180 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<b>Armor:</b> Armor\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       145     15\n<b>Left</b>          95     15\n<b>Right</b>        95     15\n<b>Rear</b>         65     15\n\n<b>Total</b>      400     60\n",
