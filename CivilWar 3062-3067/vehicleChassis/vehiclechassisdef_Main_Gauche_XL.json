    "Details": "The Main Gauche Light Support Tank is a fire support companion to Brooks Incorporated's Galleon. Though slower, topping out at only 64 km/h, five tons of armor protect it. The Main Gauche was actually submitted to the Free Worlds League Military because that organization was looking for a tank with long range capability. It finally reached full production in 3064. This variant also developed in 3066 upgrades the engine to an Extralight. The weight saved allows the Main Gauche's speed to be upgraded to a max of 97 km/h. It also adds a slight amount of armor. Though this is clearly an advantageous upgrade, it also increases the expense of the tank considerably.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 6/9 Hex: 180/270 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<b>Armor:</b> Armor\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       150     15\n<b>Left</b>         115     15\n<b>Right</b>       115     15\n<b>Rear</b>         84     15\n\n<b>Total</b>      464     60\n",
