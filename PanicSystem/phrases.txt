Mama said there'd be days like this.
Its just one of those days...
I see a bright light...
Mommy? Is that you?
I let you hit me!
Sucker shot!
I didn't want to live anyway.

Was that as close as I think it was?
Join the army, see the world they said.
I didn't like violence anyway!
I thought you liked me?
I think this guy's a little crazy.
Hey! Killin' ain't cool.
Gee... thanks.
