1. Add external animated parts to vehicles
2. Changing chassis terrain interactions
3. Forbids certain mechs/vehicles to spawn on certain biomes
4. Add custom animated hardpoints

MechResizer has been devoured
## Settings

All resize settings are exclusive, so you cannot apply layered resizing i.e. a default of 1.1 will not multiply a tag of 2. Resizing preference is in the following order: vector supplied in `<TYPE>ResizeMultiplierVectors`, tags, `<TYPE>ResizeMultipliers`, prefab, `mod.json`-supplied default, and a hard-coded default of 1.25.

The dimensions for the `*Vectors` settings are measured like: <X> - width (shoulder to shoulder), <Y> - height (toes to head), <Z> - depth (chest to back)

### Tag-Based Resizing
In addition to the settings that follow that are set in `mod.json`, you can also change the size of elements using tags. There are two formats:

1. `mr-resize-N`: `N` can be an integer or decimal number and will resize the given item equally in all dimensions
2. `mr-resize-X-Y-Z`: `X`, `Y`, and `Z` can be an integers or decimal numbers and will scale on that axis

The tags must be put in the following type of file to be applied:

Type | File Type | Tag Location
--- | --- | ---  
Mechs | `data/chassis/chassisdef_<variant>.json` | `ChassisTags`->`items`
Vehicles | `data/vehicle/vehicledef_<variant>.json` | `VehicleTags`->`items`
Turrets | `data/turrets/turretdef_<variant>.json` | `TurretTags`->`items`
Projectiles | `data/weapon/Weapon_<variant>.json` | `ComponentTags`->`items`

### `mod.json` settings
Setting | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`debug` | `boolean` | false | enable debug logging
`defaultMechSizeMultiplier` | float | 0.9 | override this to globally change all mech sizes in combat. Vanilla is 1.25
`defaultVehicleSizeMultiplier` | float | 1 | override this to globally change all vehicle sizes in combat. Vanilla is 1
`defaultTurretSizeMultiplier` | float | 1 | override this to globally change all turret sizes in combat. Vanilla is 1
`defaultProjectileSizeMultiplier` | float | 1 | override this to globally change certain weapon (missiles only ATM) projectile sizes in combat. Vanilla is 1
`mechSizePrefabMultipliers` | json hash | {} | change the size of any set of mechs that share a common `PrefabBase` in their chassis definition files. For example, making all highlander variants very large might look like: `"highlander": {"x": 8, "y": 8, "z": 8}`
`vehicleSizePrefabMultipliers` | json hash | {} | change the size of any set of vehicles that share a common `PrefabBase` in their vehicle chassis definition files.
`turretSizePrefabMultipliers` | json hash | {} | change the size of any set of turrets that share a common `PrefabBase` in their turret chassis definition files.
`projectileSizePrefabMultipliers` | json hash | {} | change the size of any set of projectiles that share a common `PrefabBase` in their weapon firing them's weapon definition files.
"MechScaleJRoot": false - if true for while resizing mech MR will try to resize j_Root transform instead of whole game object. Which can help to avoid floating mechs
                          default is false. 

### Deprecated `mod.json` Settings - please use the size change options above i
Setting | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`mechResizeMultipliers` _deprecated_ | json hash | {} | change the size of mechs using the format `"chassis string" : multiplier`. A big locust would be like `"chassisdef_locust_LCT-1V": 15`
`mechResizeMultiplierVectors` _deprecated_ | json hash | {} | change mech sizes using three dimensional multipliers with format `"chassis string": { "x": Xmulti, "y": Ymulti, "z": Zmulti }`. A very tall locust might look like `"chassisdef_locust_LCT-1V": {"x": 1,"y": 2, "z": 1}``
`vehicleResizeMultipliers` _deprecated_ | json hash | {} | change the size of vehicles using the format `"chassis string" : multiplier`. A big APC would be like `"vehiclechassisdef_APC_Wheeled": 3`
`vehicleResizeMultiplierVectors` _deprecated_ | json hash | {} | change vehicle sizes using three dimensional multipliers with format `"chassis string": { "x": Xmulti, "y": Ymulti, "z": Zmulti }`. A very long APC might look like `"vehiclechassisdef_APC_Wheeled": {"x": 1,"y": 1, "z": 2}``

	NOTE: squad can have no more than one jumpjet. This means no matter amount of actual jumpjets components you install. 
	If each operational location (squad trooper) have working jumpjet it will be counted as whole squad have one jupmjet in jump distance calculation.
	Squad can't have stability nor heat. 
	Squad can't be legged cause it have no legs internally.
	Squad can be destroyed only all units destroyed.
	Squad will get less AoE damage if some troopers dead
	Squad will get less damage from landmines if some troopers dead.

									 it will place waypoint this position instead of destination point allowing you set more complicated trajectory
									 i strongly suggest you to forbid partial movement for VTOLs and LAMs in airmech mode

                            To make it work you must follow some rules 
                            1. You can't spawn prefab containing object with your models directly. You have to create empty object, name it as you want it to be referenced,
                            and only than add objects with your models as children for this object. 
                            2. For name of parent object you have to use letters in LOWER case this is some sort of unity/game/modtek limitation.
                            3. You can search at the unity package i'm providing with this mod for examples how to create asset with prefabs engine can successfully load.

        "MaterialInfo":{
          !READ NEXT NOTE CAREFULLY IF YOU EXPERIENCED PROBJEMS WITH TEXTURING YOUR LOADABLE OBJECTS!
          Some basics: model it is mesh + material. Material is shader + shader's settings relative to this model (textures is part of settings).
          Shader is set of instruction for GPU telling it how draw your model properly. 
          If you try to use standard unity shader for your prefabs - it will work wrong cause it does not know about game rendering features.
          So, to get your models to be textured properly you have next options:
          1. If you experienced enough you can write your own shader than will work correctly in game (but if you can, why are you reading this?)
          Fortunately i've found basic shader developers using to texture objects and its settings are very similar to standard one. 
          2. You can use UABE to replace standard unity's shader to game's one. (You can't import game's shader to your unity project cause absence of shader's source)
             But it needs additional post-production phase for your asset. After every change and reassemble you have to modify your asset to replace shader.
          3. You can include MaterialInfo to your custom part definition. If you do, my code while spawning objects will search through all models in your prefab for materials you point
             and replace their shaders to ones you points (for example i'm providing possibility to replace shader to game's standard one)

                                                                           1. Root object should be empty.
