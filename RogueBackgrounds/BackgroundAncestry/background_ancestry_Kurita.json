While some, most notably the descendants of the conquered [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreRasalhague],Principality of Rasalhague]], continue to chafe at the uniformity of Draconis society, overall this has created a more cohesive populace and military than seen in the other Great Houses of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreInnerSphere],Inner Sphere]].",
