Over centuries of rule, the founding [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreHouseKurita],House Kurita]] has succeeded in uniting the people of the Combine into a single culture, one heavily molded around medieval Japanese society. While some, most notably the descendants of the conquered [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreRaselhague],Principality of Rasalhague]], continue to chafe at the uniformity of Draconis society, overall this has created a more cohesive populace and military than seen in the other Great Houses of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreInnerSphere],Inner Sphere]].",
