Despite a number of humiliating defeats in the first two [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSuccessionWars],Succession Wars]], the Lyran Commonwealth has bounced back thanks to the combined strength of its economy (the biggest of the five great [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSuccessorState],Successor States]]) and its control of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreInnerSphere],Inner Sphere]]'s largest functioning BattleMech factories. What the Lyran Commonwealth may lack in military prowess, it makes up for with raw numbers and industrial scale.",
