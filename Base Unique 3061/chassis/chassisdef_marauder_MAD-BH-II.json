The fusion engine was upgrade to an extra-light version while keeping it at the same rating to save weight, though the increased size meant three heat sinks had to be removed. The standard PPCs were upgrade to ER PPCs, both the left and right torso-mounted medium lasers were removed while the center torso medium laser was moved to the head to make room for a Gauss Rifle on the right torso and two tons of ammunition. This upgrade allowed the Bounty Hunter to engage enemies at a far greater range while still able to continuously operate without fear of overheating.",
