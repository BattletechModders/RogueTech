    "Details": "The largest gun on the Pinion is its heavy large laser. Although it experiences some targeting difficulties, it packs a strong punch into a relatively small package. On the opposite end of the spectrum are the four micro pulse lasers mounted in the Pinion's torso. These weapons are only useful at point-blank range, but the pulse technology makes them quite accurate, and make the Pinion devastating against conventional infantry. The medium pulse lasers have a decent range and are highly accurate and provide reliable, mid-range firepower. This all-energy weapon configuration allows the 'Mech to range far and wide without having to worry about resupply or ammunition explosions in combat. 14 double heat sinks keeps the 'Mech fairly cool, though an alpha strike will seriously overheat it.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Accurate Weapon - Laser</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.09</color></b>",

  "YangsThoughts": "The Pinion is part testbed, part leftovers. Developed by Clan Jade Falcon and introduced into service in 3065, the Pinion BattleMech is the second Clan 'Mech to be produced by Olivetti Weapons on Sudeten. The second-line BattleMech was designed as a patrol and guard duty 'Mech, so it has modest speed coupled with good maneuverability thanks to its jump jet range of 150 meters. Additionally, the Pinion is meant to test the effectiveness and drawbacks of heavy lasers, as early reports from Clan Star Adder indicated heavy lasers are unreliable and possibly damaging to the MechWarrior. In order to properly judge the effect of this new weapon, the Falcons decided to use garrison MechWarriors as guinea pigs. Their vitals were carefully tracked and medical evaluations were administered weekly as part of these tests.",
