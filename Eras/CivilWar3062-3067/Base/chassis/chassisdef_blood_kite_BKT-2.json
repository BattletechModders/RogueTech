  "YangsThoughts": "The Blood Kite is a BattleMech that was designed on the orders of Clan Blood Spirit Khan Ceana Boques following the deployment of the OmniMech by Clan Coyote in 2854. Because Khan Boques expected the Trials for the OmniMech technology to escalate to the point that her small Clan's touman would not be able to compete, she ordered her scientist caste to rethink the way they designed 'Mechs. Boques dictated that this design philosophy was to conform to four points that seem like they would be common sense: be as cheap as is reasonable, have a reasonable chance of surviving an engagement, sustain a steady barrage, and be as efficient as possible. In fact, many prior designs created by the Clan's scientists violated many or all of these principles. The cream of this crop was the Blood Kite, which debuted in the early part of the thirtieth century. The Blood Kite eschews the use of expensive technology and weapons, only making use of an Endo Steel internal structure to save weight. It contains as much standard armor as the engineers could fit onto the eighty-five ton frame, as well as jump jets that propel it up to ninety meters at a time.",
