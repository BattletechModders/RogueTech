    "Details": "Debuting in 3062 this variant of the Pike carries three Rotary Autocannon/2s in the turret with four tons of ammunition. A Small Laser mounted on the front discourages infantry attacks. The Pike was created at the direction of Magestrix Kyalla Centrella of the Magistracy of Canopus during the later part of the Third Succession War. Her plan was to produce an inexpensive combat vehicle so the Great Houses would wear down their BattleMech armies through attrition, and the Pike would be the tool she envisioned for the task. However, sending vehicles to market in the Inner Sphere was to be more costly than anticipated. With the Great Houses' shrinking numbers of ships in their JumpShip fleets, the vehicle did not make the impact she had hoped it would. It became a favorite of ComStar's growing garrison forces for their HPG complexes.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 3/5 hexes / 90/150 meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Ferro-Fibrous\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       220     30\n<b>Left</b>         150     30\n<b>Right</b>       150     30\n<b>Rear</b>        140     30\n<b>Turret</b>      200     30\n\n<b>Total</b>      860    150</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Protected Mechanisms</color>",
