    "Details": "The new Shogun C 3 is firmly aimed at tradition-minded Clan customers. Marketed for the same niche as the old Warhawk, which still captures the minds and hearts of so many, the new Shogun increases speed at the cost of the enormous short-range damage potential of earlier variants. There are few complaints, as the C 3 may be the most balanced Shogun to date. The new Artemis V FCS and the PPC capacitor forced a replacement of the venerable original HartfordCo targeting system with a far more modern and advanced one. The new targeting solution is amongst the best available, and is one of the reasons behind the success of this new variant. Despite carrying seven tons of ammunition, the 'Mech is surprisingly tough, thanks to CASE II.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Barrel Fist</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.21</color></b>\n\n<br><br><color=#FFEF00>Arm Actuator Limits: Left Lower, Right Lower</color>",

  "YangsThoughts": "The Shogun began production before the Star League fell and eventually was thought to be lost to the Succession Wars. The 'Mech suddenly reappeared when Wolf's Dragoons showed up in 3005, bringing a sizable number of Shoguns with them. The 'Mech was intended to be used as an urban combat 'Mech where its jumping distance and slow speed makes it able to easily traverse the close confines of a city. Though the Dragoons brought Shoguns with them from the Clan Homeworlds, they could not reach a deal with any manufacturer that met their desires, so by 3068 the total count of the 'Mech in the Inner Sphere was reduced to two, both of which were in the hands of Wannamaker's Widowmakers, taken as salvage from the Dragoons.",
