    "Details": "The Jackalope JLP-BD's eight jump jets and 240-rated XL engine allow it to leap up to 240 meters and reach a top speed of 129 km/h, giving it the ability deploy rapidly and quickly get to wherever it needs to go on the battlefield. This speed gives it an additional degree of protection beyond its six and a half tons of ferro-fibrous armor and its Clean Sweep laser anti-missile system. Its key component is its Clan designed light active probe, making it a valuable scout while leaving enough room for additional equipment. The 'Mech's principal weaponry includes two Clan-tech ER medium lasers, which are located in its stubby but flexible arms. Additionally, an ATM-6 launcher mounted in the right torso provides the Jackalope added punch at all ranges. However the design only has room for one ton of ammunition, cutting down its endurance in longer campaigns and reducing the pilot to reliance on the lasers.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Narrow/Low Profile</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.05</color></b>\n\n<br><br><color=#FFEF00>Arm Actuator Limits: Left Upper, Right Upper</color>",

Designed to serve in recon and pursuit lances, this compact and swift BattleMech was used to full effect in combat, and additionally served as a training 'Mech and as an arena combat 'Mech. The 'Mech gets its name from a mythical animal which was said to have existed on Terra's North American continent.",
