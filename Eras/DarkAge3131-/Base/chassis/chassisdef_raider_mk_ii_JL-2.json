    "Details": "The Mark II JL-2 variant of the Raider owes its development to Bannson Industries R&D team's success with the development of their own RAC/2. Though not included in the original design due to weight issues, the weapon design was too good to drop completely. The autocannon gives the Mk. II more accurate firepower at long ranges, while the standard model was forced to use a modest ranged and slightly inaccurate weapon for ranged attacks. The installation of the autocannon and its two tons of ammunition would necessitate the removal of the original MRM-10 and associated ammunition, as well as downgrading the engine to a 150-rated engine. This thus reduced the Mech's maximum speed of 50 km/h, while however under certain conditions, it would be able to reach the original design's standard maximum running speed while using TSM. However, the engine reduction would prove to be a boon to the variant's armor protection, where its protection was bolstered to 10 tons of standard armor.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Integrated Searchlight</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.04</color></b>",

  "YangsThoughts": "The Raider was an unusual experimental medium BattleMech, which was the brain child of a Republican Industrialist named Jacob Bannson. The design was created as a means to skirt around Republic of the Sphere restrictions on military hardware under the project name ''Jacob's Ladder'', and Bannson's technical and engineering teams would utilize whatever technology they could access to reach their goal. The resulting design turned out to be not necessarily a failure, with the Raider proving to be a commercial success when it first appeared on the battlefields by 3134.",
