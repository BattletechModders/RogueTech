    "Details": "Unveiled in 3110 the Partisan AA Vehicle, a lighter take on the original Partisan Air Defense Tank, was meant to be cheaper and faster but still be equally effective in the anti-aircraft role. Produced in 3134, this version of the Partisan AA would give the vehicle a longer reach than before, while gaining secondary weaponry which the Standard Model lacked. Gone is the standard LB-5X Class autocannons, in their place are a pair of Class 2 Hypervelocity Autocannons. Though lacking the punch of the Standard's bigger LB-5Xs, the HVAC/2s accuracy is improved by adding a Targeting Computer to the vehicle. As a secondary weapon, the vehicle is fitted with a 10-tubed Rocket Launcher in the turret.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 5/8 hexes / 150/240 meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Ferro-Fibrous\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       120     25\n<b>Left</b>         120     25\n<b>Right</b>       120     25\n<b>Rear</b>         90     25\n<b>Turret</b>       90     25\n\n<b>Total</b>      540    125</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Anti-Air Targeting</color>",
