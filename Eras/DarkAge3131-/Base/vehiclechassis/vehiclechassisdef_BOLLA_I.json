    "Details": "After the Word of Blake was defeated in the Jihad, Maxwell-Pulaski Motors modified the design slightly and produced it for the Republic of the Sphere in 3084. The main differences are the removal of its Blakist features. The infantry bay was reduced to four tons, and the C3i system was replaced by a C3 slave unit. The machine gun ammunition was reduced to half a ton. All these changes increased the pod space available to the RAF Bollas by four and a half tons, but the turret can only mount fifteen tons of equipment. The Stealth Armor was retained, as was the Guardian ECM suite.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 5/8 Hex: 150/240 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Vehicle Stealth Armor\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       170     30\n<b>Left</b>         160     30\n<b>Right</b>       160     30\n<b>Rear</b>        140     30\n<b>Turret</b>      200     30\n\n<b>Total</b>      830    150</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Off Roader</color>\n\n<color=#ffcc00> Omni Vehicle</color>",
