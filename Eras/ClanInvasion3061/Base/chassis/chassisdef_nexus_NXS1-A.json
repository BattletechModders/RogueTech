    "Details": "As a recon 'Mech intended to rarely engage an enemy in a pitched battle, the Nexus is armed with a Medium Laser backed up by two highly accurate Medium Pulse Lasers. As a weapon of last resort, the Nexus also has two Small Lasers. For added protection against missile attacks, the Nexus has an AMS. The Nexus has a top speed of 119 km/h and is powered by a 175 rated fusion engine which is both light and rugged. To save weight without the vulnerability of an XL engine, the Nexus is built on a Endo Steel chassis. For protection, the 'Mech carries a light two tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor, relying on its speed and maneuverability, which is enhanced with a jumping capability of up to one hundred and twenty meters. Finally, to handle the heat from the arsenal of energy weapons, the Nexus carries ten double heat sinks.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Nimble</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 0.98</color></b>",

  "YangsThoughts": "The BattleMech known as the Nexus was originally based on the Jackrabbit, a light scout and combat vehicle and infantry support 'Mech built for the Star League Defense Force by Skobel MechWorks. Ironically, the Jackrabbit ended testing two weeks before Stefan Amaris seized power on Terra and was instead primarily used by units loyal to Amaris against the SLDF in General Kerensky's drive to liberate the Terran Hegemony. Though the SLDF captured Skobel's plant relatively intact, thanks to the stigma of being used against his forces Kerensky ordered it shutdown and the unloved Jackrabbit disappeared into history outside of ComStar's records. With the Com Guards looking to recoup their grievous losses in the wake of the Battle of Tukayyid, in 3054 Precentor Martial Anastasius Focht ordered the Skobel plant reactivated, reworking the slower Jackrabbit into a fast and highly mobile recon striker 'Mech he renamed the Nexus.",
