    "Details": "As an early Clan design, the Great Wyrm utilizes less advanced technology compared to later Clan 'Mechs. As such, it is built on a standard chassis, powered by a 225 fusion engine, and is protected by seven tons of armor. A max speed of 86.4 km/h was respectable, and the heat generated was kept under control by the base 10 double heat sinks. The Great Wyrm mounts weaponry that covers all ranges, giving it good engagement flexibility. For long-ranges it makes use of a LRM-10 and a pair of UAC/2s, and uses its speed to stay out of the range of most enemies' guns while peppering them with these. If any enemy manages to close, or if the one ton of ammunition for those weapons is expended, the Great Wyrm also mounts a pair of ER medium lasers and ER small lasers.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Stable</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.07</color></b>\n\n<color=#FFEF00>Arm Actuator Limit: Right Upper</color>",

  "YangsThoughts": "The Great Wyrm was one of the first unique Clan BattleMechs ever developed. Clan Mongoose scientists used the specifications for the Dragon as the basis for their new creation, and were able to update it to their liking in a little more than a year. Not only was it designed to Clan specifications, but the Mongoose creators reduced the Dragon's weight by 15 tons. The Great Wyrm first saw action in 2844 against Clan Star Adder, and soon found its way into the touman of every Clan. With the development of the OmniMech, however, the Great Wyrm was reduced to a solahma unit and production finally ceased in 2872.",
