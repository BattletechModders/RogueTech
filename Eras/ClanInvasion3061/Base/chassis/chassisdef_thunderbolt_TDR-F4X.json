    "Details": "When the Magistracy of Canopus found an abandoned Star League facility in 3018, amongst the stored equipment was a number of Thunderbolt chassis. All of them were severely damage and missing key components such as the weapons, gyro and engine. The Magistracy had to acquire these at great cost from the open market, and therefore opted to install internal combustion engines instead of the fusion cores. The F4X was the final version, overhauled to use an AC/10 in the right forearm while a pair of ten-tube MRM launchers was fitted into the left torso.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Multi Trac</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 0.87</color></b>",

  "YangsThoughts": "The Thunderbolt started production in 2491 as a planetary-assault 'Mech, and in fact was one of the heaviest 'Mechs that could be produced at that time. Since then the 'Mech, known affectionately as the T-Bolt, has had its classification changed as larger 'Mechs were built but thanks to periodic updates it is still feared and respected by many. With its varied arsenal, the Thunderbolt remains one of the best-armed 'Mechs, making it capable of serving in many roles. It is also an incredibly well-armored 'Mech, rivaling or exceeding the amount of armor carried by some assault 'Mechs. One downside to the Thunderbolt though is poor heat management.",
