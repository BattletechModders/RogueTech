    "Details": "The Striker STC-2C is built using rugged, off-the-shelf technologies that allow it to stand up to a great deal of punishment and enable easy repair. The 2C has a top speed of 64.8 km/h, provided by a 320-rated Fusion engine. For protection, it carries thirteen and a half tons of armor, solidly average for a 'Mech of the Striker's size. The Striker STC-2C dissipates the heat from its arsenal with fifteen standard heat sinks. It has an arsenal that is capable of engaging an enemy at a variety of ranges. At maximum range, the 2C brings its PPC and a AC/5 to bear. As the enemy closes, it can also make use of its Large Laser, though the unit's pilot will need to monitor their heat generation carefully. Finally, for close range defense, it has three Medium Lasers.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Easy to Maintain</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.12</color></b>\n\n<br><br><color=#FFEF00>Arm Actuator Limit: Left Lower</color>",

  "YangsThoughts": "The Striker was originally commissioned by the SLDF high command in 2571 for non-Royal SLDF units. Along with the Stalker, the Striker became one of the most common 'Mechs in service. The Striker was built with the intent of being rugged and reliable, but more importantly, allowed House Lords to reserve their precious and limited numbers of assault BattleMechs for their own personal armies. In this way, the Striker may have been the show of good faith the House Lords needed to make the Star League work. In spite of the 'Mech's dependability, the Striker was marginal compared with later assault BattleMechs, and was eventually relegated to serving in militia units, with the highest concentration ending up on the rimward edge of the Terran Hegemony. After the destruction of the Stormvanger lines in 2867, fewer than 300 Strikers were known to exist in 3058.",
