    "Details": "Named after Archon Robert Marsden, who had died the year before, the Marsden Main Battle Tank entered into service with the Lyran Commonwealth Armed Forces in 2396. Combining a time-tested, simple design with modern equipment, it proved a successful general workhorse MBT for the Commonwealth for almost seven decades before it was pushed into second-line duties by its successor, the very similar Marsden II. The Marsden carried an Arcturan Arms Longarm Series Autocannon/5 as its main gun on a fully pivoting turret. The autocannon benefited from an advanced fire control system and quickly gained a reputation for accuracy. The turret also contained a coaxial General A70 Model machine gun for use against infantry. The real innovation, however, was the six-tube Alpha Wave missile launcher embedded in the thick frontal armor of the tank's hull. The basic design was eventually copied by other major states, leading to almost identical tanks with different names in other militaries.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>ICE: Air breathing Combustion Engine.
