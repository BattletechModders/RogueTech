It fought all the way though Operation LIBERATION, suffering the highest losses of any artillery units. It is unknown if any were taken on Kerensky's Exodus, but each of the Successor States were able to take possession of many of the vehicles that were left behind; these went on to participate in the Succession Wars.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 4/6 hexes / 120/180 meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Ferro-Fibrous\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       150     20\n<b>Left</b>         150     20\n<b>Right</b>       150     20\n<b>Rear</b>         85     20\n\n<b>Total</b>      535     80</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Protected Mechanisms</color>",
