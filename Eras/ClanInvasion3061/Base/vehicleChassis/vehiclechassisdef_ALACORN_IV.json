Another prototype developed shortly after the Mk III in 2588, this variant was essentially an upgrade of the Mk. II to alleviate its armor problems. It was still outfitted with the ultimate big-gun of its era: a trio of AC/20s. Despite addressing some of the concerns of the Mk. II, it saw a limited production run.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 3/5 Hex: 90/150 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Armor\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       250     50\n<b>Left</b>         195     50\n<b>Right</b>       195     50\n<b>Rear</b>        135     50\n<b>Turret</b>      250     50\n\n<b>Total</b>      1025    250</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Improved Communications</color>",
