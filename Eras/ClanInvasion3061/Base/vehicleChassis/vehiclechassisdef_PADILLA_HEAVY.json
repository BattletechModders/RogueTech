    "Details": "Introduced in 2620 by Leopard Armor of Terra for the SLDF, named in honor of Colonel Alfred Padilla, the Padilla heavy artillery tank was created as companion to the Chaparral. Stationed well back from the front lines, the Padilla was usually paired with light, fast BattleMechs equipped with Target Acquisition Gear. If caught in a firefight, the Padilla relied on its speed and manoeuvrability for protection, as it was built with only five and a half tons of armor. The vehicle's primary weaponry is its forward mounted Arrow IV Missile Launcher. The vehicle's defensive weaponry consists of a pair of Medium Pulse Lasers and an Anti-Missile System. The tank also mounts a TAG.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 5/8 Hex: 150/240 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Armor\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       170     40\n<b>Left</b>         125     40\n<b>Right</b>       125     40\n<b>Rear</b>         60     40\n\n<b>Total</b>      480    160</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Accurate Weapon - Missiles</color>",
