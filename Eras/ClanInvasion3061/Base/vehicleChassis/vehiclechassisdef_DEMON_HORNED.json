    "Details": "This 2721 SLDF variant replaces the short range missile launcher and CASE for a pair of forward-firing Medium Lasers and two extra heat sinks. Side firing Medium Lasers are fitted in the forward arch. However, this leaves the vehicles' other flanks unarmed, with the exception of the turret mounted Gauss Rifle. It should be noted that it was rarely deployed except in defensive positions. The Demon was originally created by the SLDF as its standard fighting vehicle in 2716. A match for any light or medium BattleMech, the Demon had good maneuverability and was protected by ten tons of slab armor, most of it concentrated in its front. Due to the nature of its powerful main weapon the Demon was often used in ambush attacks and fought in pairs instead of the usual four-vehicle lance. The vehicle's main disadvantage was its lack of speed, which made it vulnerable to faster 'Mechs and other vehicles able to maneuver around and engage its weaker rear armor.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 4/6 hexes / 120/180 meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Armor\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       260     30\n<b>Left</b>         155     30\n<b>Right</b>       155     30\n<b>Rear</b>        110     30\n<b>Turret</b>      160     30\n\n<b>Total</b>      840    150</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Main Battle Tank</color>",
