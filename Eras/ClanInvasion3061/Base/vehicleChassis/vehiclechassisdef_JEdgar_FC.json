    "Details": "Developed by Scarborough Manufacturers on Al Na'ir in 2998, this J. Edgar used a Fuel Cell engine instead of the fusion engine of the original. Though the ground speed remained the same, the armament did not. The Laser and missile systems were dropped in favor of a Light Rifle and twin Machine Guns. The design was seen as only marginally effective, and when Takashi Kurita came to power he cancelled the project. Designed as a fast, cheap, and effective raider, the J.Edgar was the last military vehicle that Alphard Trading Corporation manufactured before they disappeared during the conflagration of the Succession Wars. Unfortunately, the J.Edgar proved quite ineffective and was soon phased out, until Pinard Protectorates Limited licensed the design and began manufacturing new variants. \n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Fuel Cell: Improved vehicle engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 11/17 Hex: 330/510 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Armor\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       175     15\n<b>Left</b>          95     15\n<b>Right</b>        95     15\n<b>Rear</b>         60     15\n<b>Turret</b>      123     15\n\n<b>Total</b>      548     75\n</color>",
