    "Details": "Sacrificing firepower for carrying capacity, this Maxim can transport up to 12 tons of infantry. In exchange, its weapons are limited to a Streak SRM-6, 2 ER Medium Lasers, and a TAG, all mounted in its turret. Originally produced by Maxim Transport Industries, before a series of scandals led to its closure in 3039, the fast and heavily armed Maxim quickly became the model example of a transport throughout the Inner Sphere. Still produced via different companies, the Maxim is still heavily used by many units as their principal APC. It has proven itself popular both to unit commanders, who respect its firepower, speed and ability to carry a full platoon of infantry, and to the troops it carries, who respect its roomy, comfortable infantry bay. \n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 8/12 Hex: 240/360 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Ferro-Fibrous\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       120     25\n<b>Left</b>         120     25\n<b>Right</b>       120     25\n<b>Rear</b>        100     25\n<b>Turret</b>      100     25\n\n<b>Total</b>      560    125</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Rugged</color>",
