    "Details": "The Striker received a major refit during the 3040s, its Internal Combustion Engine was replaced with a Fusion Engine. Ferro-Fibrous Armor replaced the original's standard armor. The Vehicle's LRM launcher was upgraded to an LRM-15, and further enhanced with an Artemis IV fire control system. The original, larger SRM launcher is exchanged for a pair of Streak SRM-2 Launchers, fed by a single ton of ammunition. The Striker Light Tank started out as a joint project venture between Valiant Systems and Wunderland Enterprises on the world of Johnsondale. They united in their efforts to create a joint company known as Valiant Vehicles, with the Striker being their first product. The low cost light fire support tank became a mainstay of the AFFS after its introduction in the first decade of the thirty-first century, and orders for the Striker soon outstripped the Valiant production line's capacity.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 5/8 hexes / 150/240 meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Ferro-Fibrous\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       160     20\n<b>Left</b>         130     20\n<b>Right</b>       130     20\n<b>Rear</b>        105     20\n<b>Turret</b>      135     20\n\n<b>Total</b>      660    100</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Accurate Weapon - Missiles</color>",
