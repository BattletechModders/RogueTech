    "Details": "Retaining the infantry bay, the variant drops two of its four flamers and 3 tons of ammo. This was exchanged for a pair of SRM 2 launchers mounted in the turret with 2 tons of ammunition. Designed by United Mechanics, LLC on Apollo for the Rim Worlds Republic as an anti-insurgent vehicle. Originally based on an infantry personnel carrier, it was designed for urban assault against urban shelters. The vehicle was used to ram its target buildings so it could deliver its infantry squad into the breached structure. Originally named the Ram, the vehicle crews during its original time of use, came to use another name. It was referred to as the Ignis, with flamers reminding them of the Vedic god of fire. \n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>ICE: Air breathing Combustion Engine.
