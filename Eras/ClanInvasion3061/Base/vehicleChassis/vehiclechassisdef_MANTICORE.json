    "Details": "The Manticore is one of the best-designed and most powerful heavy tanks ever created, built to combat BattleMechs in support of infantry formations. Although the Manticore mounts a variety of weapons to handle a variety of combat roles and ranges, and is heavily armored for a vehicle of its weight, it is not equipped to deal with the raw firepower of Assault weight vehicles such as the Demolisher or the Behemoth. Despite this, the popularity of the Manticore has remained high, even during the Succession Wars era with its use of an expensive and rare Fusion Engine. Originally developed by TechniCorp during the Reunification War, the destruction of the company's head office on Terra during the Amaris Coup spread the Manticore across the Inner Sphere as other manufacturers absorbed their facilities.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 4/6 Hex: 120/180 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Armor\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       230     30\n<b>Left</b>         165     30\n<b>Right</b>       165     30\n<b>Rear</b>        130     30\n<b>Turret</b>      210     30\n\n<b>Total</b>      900    150</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Main Battle Tank</color>",
