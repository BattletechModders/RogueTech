    "Details": "Developed by the New Earth Trading Company in 2587, the Alacorn has developed a reputation as an effective and dependable tank. The design is popular with mercenary units and minor powers who can't afford BattleMechs, because of its heavy offensive weaponry and thirteen tons of armor; however, this payload is only possible through the use of an expensive and fragile 285 XL Engine. The three turret-mounted Norse-Storm Gauss Rifles allow the Alacorn to unleash devastating barrages at range, with five tons of reloads offering excellent endurance in combat.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 3/5 hexes / 90/150 meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Armor\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       270     50\n<b>Left</b>         205     50\n<b>Right</b>       205     50\n<b>Rear</b>        140     50\n<b>Turret</b>      260     50\n\n<b>Total</b>      1080    250</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Improved Communications</color>",
