    "Details": "During the Succession Wars, many J. Edgars were heavily damaged, so their expensive and rare fusion engines were usually replaced with older and bulkier Internal Combustion Engines. First seen in 2854 this alteration greatly reduced the tank's maximum speed to 129 km/h and required a full ton of armor plating to be removed. Designed as a fast, cheap, and effective raider, the J.Edgar was the last military vehicle that Alphard Trading Corporation manufactured before they disappeared during the conflagration of the Succession Wars. Unfortunately, the J.Edgar proved quite ineffective and was soon phased out, until Pinard Protectorates Limited licensed the design and began manufacturing new variants. \n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>ICE: Air breathing Combustion Engine.
