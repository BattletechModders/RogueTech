    "Details": "Armed with the same weaponry as its fusion-powered counterpart, this original diesel-engine model of the Drillson was much slower due to the additional weight of the heat sinks and amplifiers. Its cruising speed is 64.8 km/h. Entering service with the Lyran Commonwealth's military 3025, the Drillson is another example of the LCAF's preference for heavy vehicles. It's excellent performance during the Fourth Succession War established it as one of the best of its type. The Drillson is very heavy for a hover vehicle. Much of this weight is invested in protection. The Drillson relies mostly on the Cyclops Eye Large Laser based in its turret. This weapon and its associated fire control system were developed specifically for this vehicle by the ordnance division of Cyclops, Inc. This unconventional design uses a combination of laser energy and particle-beam technology. The unique structure of this system enables it to dispense with the relatively long barrels of standard large lasers.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>ICE: Air breathing Combustion Engine.
