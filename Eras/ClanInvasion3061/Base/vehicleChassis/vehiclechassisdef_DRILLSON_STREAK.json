    "Details": "This updated post-Clan Invasion model of the Drillson from 3053 features an updated weapons package. The HoverTech SRM racks have been removed and more efficient Streak SRM-2s fitted. The venerable Cyclops Eye system has been retired in favor of a modern Large Pulse Laser. Entering service with the Lyran Commonwealth's military 3025, the Drillson is another example of the LCAF's preference for heavy vehicles. It's excellent performance during the Fourth Succession War established it as one of the best of its type. The Drillson is very heavy for a hover vehicle. Much of this weight is invested in protection. The Drillson relies mostly on the Cyclops Eye Large Laser based in its turret. This weapon and its associated fire control system were developed specifically for this vehicle by the ordnance division of Cyclops, Inc. This unconventional design uses a combination of laser energy and particle-beam technology. The unique structure of this system enables it to dispense with the relatively long barrels of standard large lasers.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 9/14 hexes / 270/420 meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Armor\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       145     25\n<b>Left</b>         105     25\n<b>Right</b>       105     25\n<b>Rear</b>        100     25\n<b>Turret</b>      125     25\n\n<b>Total</b>      580    125</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Accurate Weapon - Laser</color>",
