    "Details": "The increased use of heavily armed and armored strike VTOL by the Inner Sphere eventually forced a Clan response. The Kukri was the result, a VTOL designed to hunt its own kind. It is unusually heavily armored for a Clan vehicle, and further protected by AMS front and rear. Early armament proposals included large missile racks to ensure some hits vulnerable areas like rotors and maneuvering jets. However, noting the effective AMS carried by many of its targets the design committee eventually proposed a Plasma Rifle, a quartet of AP Gauss Rifles and, as an apparent afterthought, an ER Micro Laser Array. Although the Scientist Caste insisted plasma would be effective in air to air engagements many were skeptical. However the Great Houses of the Inner Sphere also use tanks and conventional infantry in quantity, both highly vulnerable to the Kukri’s weapons. Higher-ups were eventually satisfied that even if it failed as a fighter it might succeed as a tank hunter. There was no need for worry. During the first combat trial Kukri pilot Larysa Kosko disabled two enemy Balac VTOL within 10 seconds of engaging. She then went on to win the subsequent dogfight with a third. Its success on the battlefield caused a minor increase in the status of aircraft pilots in some circles. Unlike most combat vehicles with large crews of poorly trained washout mechwarriors, the single pilot (albeit accompanied by a communications and sensor operator) appealed to the ideal of personal glory so important to the Clans. 'Perhaps there is honor in facing an equal enemy in such a machine. As these warriors dance across the sky with speed and precision it is not too unlike the light ‘mechs below.' - Alerik Sandusky, Mechwarrior, Clan Ghost Bear\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 9/14 Hex: 270/420 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Ferro-Lamellor (C)\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       150     32\n<b>Left</b>         115     32\n<b>Right</b>       115     32\n<b>Rear</b>        100     32\n<b>Turret</b>       20     32\n\n<b>Total</b>      500    160</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Anti-Air Targeting</color>",
