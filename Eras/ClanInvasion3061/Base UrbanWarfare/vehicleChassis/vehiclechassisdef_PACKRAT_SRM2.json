    "Details": "The Packrat is a speedy eight-wheeled vehicle that is designed for deep infiltration and sabotage. First produced by Robertson Technologies, the vehicle is meant to operate on its own deep behind enemy lines for extended periods of time. While excelling in this role, the Packrat suffered during the Succession Wars as, with the decline in knowledge brought about by the conflicts, many had their advanced fusion engines removed for use elsewhere. The technological renaissance brought about by the Helm Memory Core recovery also proved to be a turning point for the Packrat, as manufacturers in the Lyran Commonwealth were able to put fusion-powered Packrats back into production and help spread them across the Inner Sphere.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 7/11 hexes / 210/330 meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Armor\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>        80     10\n<b>Left</b>          80     10\n<b>Right</b>        80     10\n<b>Rear</b>         80     10\n\n<b>Total</b>      320     40</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Improved Communications</color>",
