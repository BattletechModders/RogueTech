The engine was upgraded to an ExtraLight version and ten double heat sinks improved heat management. The overall armor protection was increased by one ton and replaced with Lexington Ltd. High Grade Ferro-Fibrous armor. The primary weapon on the 'Mech was a Thunderbolt-12 Large Pulse Laser built into the right arm, though it still retained the two medium lasers and machine guns of the original. Additionally an anti-missile system was mounted on the right arm, with its two tons of ammo (along with two tons of machine gun ammo) protected by CASE in the left torso. Its primary difference from other variants introduced during the time period was the addition of a MASC system, which allowed the 'Mech to reach speeds of up to 129.6 in short bursts.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Improved Communications</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.03</color></b>",
