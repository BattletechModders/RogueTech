    "Details": "Another Autocannon based configuration, the C is can be cast in a role against infantry forces and vehicles. Mounted in its turret is an LB-10X AC with two tons of ammunition. The Scapha Hovertank is a thirty-second century Hover OmniVehicle which was originally exclusively produced for the Armed Forces of the Republic of the Sphere. Built by Grumman Industries on Terra in 3123, the Scapha was designed with the best technologies of its time. It would go on to serve in multiple roles in the RAF due to its flexibility and firepower. The design was highly popular in the service of the RAF well into the fall of most the Republic's Prefectures to invading forces after 3132. While part of many Republic Standing Guard units, the Scapha was noted for delaying the fall of many Republic worlds. Designed as a fast and flexible tank, the Scapha is powered by a Strand 265-rated Extra-Extralight Fusion Engine, giving excess speed. Despite the cost of the engine and its bulkiness, the Scapha has thirteen tons of pod space for weapons and equipment. Protecting its armored hide is 7.5 tons of Grumman CRR Reflective Armor which dampens the damage caused by energy weapons.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 11/17 Hex: 330/510 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Reflective Coating\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       170     20\n<b>Left</b>         101     20\n<b>Right</b>       101     20\n<b>Rear</b>        100     20\n<b>Turret</b>      160     20\n\n<b>Total</b>      632    100\n</color><color=#ffcc00> Omni Vehicle</color>\n",
