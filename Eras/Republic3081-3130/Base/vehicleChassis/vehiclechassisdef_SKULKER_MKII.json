    "Details": "The Skulker Wheeled Scout is the much larger cousin of the Swift Wind scout car and originally based on the Heavy APC design. Due to it being larger than any scout car, it can act as a mobile communication outpost. With its advanced sensor suite which is tied to both its communication and targeting systems, it can navigate with only its sensors. While hot environments would normally wreak havoc upon its advanced electronics, the heat sinks from its Medium Laser cool the sensors while the laser is not in use. This allows it to operate in even the hottest environments where other scout vehicles cannot. The Skulker comes with four and a half tons of armor as standard. \n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fuel Cell: Improved vehicle engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 7/11 hexes / 210/330 meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Armor\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       140     10\n<b>Left</b>         100     10\n<b>Right</b>       100     10\n<b>Rear</b>         90     10\n\n<b>Total</b>      430     40</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Accurate Weapon - Laser</color>",
