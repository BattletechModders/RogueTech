    "Details": "The Nuberu Anti-Aircraft Tank is a post-Jihad design, which was developed jointly by Clan Snow Raven and the Outworlds Alliance in the early 3080s. After the end of the Jihad, pirate activity in the newly expanded Raven Alliance began to increase to the point that the OA's armed forces were no longer able provide adequate air cover for its worlds' ground forces. Based on the Partisan, the Nuberu use advanced technology to provide a greater air-defense capacity to both Clan and Alliance ground forces. Powered by a 180-rated Fuel Cell engine, the vehicle has a modest 54 kilometer per hour speed, keeping pace with slower combat vehicles. Protecting its hull, Clan Scientists have added 9.5 tons of Clan Laser Reflective Armor. Also known as the 'Numantia,' this variant is designed to be a companion to the the standard model. The Nuberu 2's mission is to act as a bodyguard unit for the vulnerable anti-air model. The forward turret has pair of Streak SRM-6 Launchers for short range engagements, while the rear turret features four LRM-15 Launchers for long-range engagements. The vehicle has also been given six Light Machine Guns. \n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fuel Cell: Improved vehicle engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 3/5 Hex: 90/150 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Glazed (C)\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       200     30\n<b>Left</b>         150     30\n<b>Right</b>       150     30\n<b>Rear</b>        140     30\n<b>Turret</b>      200     30\n\n<b>Total</b>      840    150</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Anti-Air Targeting</color>",
