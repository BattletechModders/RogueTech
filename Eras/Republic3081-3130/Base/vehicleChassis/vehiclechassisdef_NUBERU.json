    "Details": "The Nuberu Anti-Aircraft Tank is a post-Jihad design, which was developed jointly by Clan Snow Raven and the Outworlds Alliance in the early 3080s. After the end of the Jihad, pirate activity in the newly expanded Raven Alliance began to increase to the point that the OA's armed forces were no longer able provide adequate air cover for its worlds' ground forces. Based on the Partisan, the Nuberu use advanced technology to provide a greater air-defense capacity to both Clan and Alliance ground forces. Powered by a 180-rated Fuel Cell engine, the vehicle has a modest 54 kilometer per hour speed, keeping pace with slower combat vehicles. Protecting its hull, Clan Scientists have added 9.5 tons of Clan Laser Reflective Armor.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fuel Cell: Improved vehicle engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 3/5 Hex: 90/150 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Glazed (C)\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       200     30\n<b>Left</b>         150     30\n<b>Right</b>       150     30\n<b>Rear</b>        150     30\n<b>Turret</b>      200     30\n\n<b>Total</b>      850    150</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Anti-Air Targeting</color>",
