    "Details": "A medium-range fighter and spotter, the F Configuration mounts a basic AC/5 guided by a Targeting Computer. The vehicle carries two tons worth of ammunition for the weapon, allowing carrying different ammo types. A TAG unit allows it act as spotter for artillery and units using semi-guided LRM launchers. The Scapha Hovertank is a thirty-second century Hover OmniVehicle which was originally exclusively produced for the Armed Forces of the Republic of the Sphere. Built by Grumman Industries on Terra in 3123, the Scapha was designed with the best technologies of its time. It would go on to serve in multiple roles in the RAF due to its flexibility and firepower. The design was highly popular in the service of the RAF well into the fall of most the Republic's Prefectures to invading forces after 3132. While part of many Republic Standing Guard units, the Scapha was noted for delaying the fall of many Republic worlds. Designed as a fast and flexible tank, the Scapha is powered by a Strand 265-rated Extra-Extralight Fusion Engine, giving excess speed. Despite the cost of the engine and its bulkiness, the Scapha has thirteen tons of pod space for weapons and equipment. Protecting its armored hide is 7.5 tons of Grumman CRR Reflective Armor which dampens the damage caused by energy weapons.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 11/17 Hex: 330/510 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Reflective Coating\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       178     20\n<b>Left</b>         105     20\n<b>Right</b>       105     20\n<b>Rear</b>        100     20\n<b>Turret</b>      160     20\n\n<b>Total</b>      648    100\n</color><color=#ffcc00> Omni Vehicle</color>\n",
