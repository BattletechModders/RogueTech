    "Details": "The largest change is the engine exchange. Instead of a Fusion or Internal Combustion Engine, Maxwell's engineers used a Fuel Cell engine. This engine trade allowed engineers to remove extra fusion engine shielding that was no longer needed. The engineers also used a pair of Sponson Turrets for the secondary weapons instead of the standard turret. Dropping the turret and heavy fusion engine provided the design team with enough room to double the Thumper Artillery's ammunition bay. The standard ER Small Laser was also removed. Secondary weapons on this version are now a single SRM-2 and Machine Gun mounted in each Sponson Turret. For additional protection the Thumper Maxwell employs an Angel ECM Suite and CASE. The Thumper was created by Brooks Incorporated as a cheap knock off of the SLDF's Thor Artillery Vehicle. The vehicle was mass produced and sold to the Successor States from 2735 to 3046. The Thumper mounts its namesake; the Thumper Artillery piece.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fuel Cell: Improved vehicle engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 4/6 Hex: 120/180 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Armor\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       300     30\n<b>Left</b>         240     30\n<b>Right</b>       240     30\n<b>Rear</b>        175     30\n\n<b>Total</b>      955    120</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Stable Weapons</color>",
