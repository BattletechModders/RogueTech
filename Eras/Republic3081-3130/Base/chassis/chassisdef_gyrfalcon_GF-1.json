    "Details": "Built for speed, firepower, and simplicity, the Gyrfalcon became common in Jade Falcon Stars. Its 275-Rated Extra-Light Fusion Engine would help propel the design into the battlefield at 86 km/h and at bursts to 108 km/h with the help of its MASC. Included in its construction is a Partial Wing, which gives the design the ability to jump further than the normal 150 meters that its Jump Jets would be capable of. In addition to its regular sensors, the engineers would fit a Light Active Probe in the 'Mech's head to help it identify potential enemy targets. While it has been noted that its MechWarriors have it customized for their purposes, this design's original weapons layout consisted of two Series 6b Extended Range Large Lasers and two Type OVR-V LB 2-X ACs mounted in its shortened arms actuators. In addition to these ranged weapons systems, engineers would go on to reinforce the Gyrfalcon's legs. This is a nod to their touman changing its attitude towards the use of physical attacks, namely using Death from Above maneuver.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Distracting</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.11</color></b>\n\n<br><br><color=#FFEF00>Arm Actuator Limits: Left Upper, Right Upper</color>",
