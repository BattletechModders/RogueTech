    "Details": "The Night Wolf has a wide range of weaponry, which includes a Heavy Large Laser in the right torso and an ER medium laser in its right arm. To alleviate the targeting issues caused by the Heavy Laser, the 'Mech has been fitted with a Targeting Computer. For ranged attacks, the 'Mech utilizes a pair of ATM 9 Launchers mounted in both of the 'Mechs' arms. To help deal with the advent of increased conventional vehicles and infantry forces, the 'Mechs left arm is fitted with a Plasma Cannon. As a final defensive precaution, an anti-missile system is situated on the 'Mech's head to take down incoming missile fire.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Hyper-Extending Actuators</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.22</color></b>\n\n<br><br><color=#FFEF00>Arm Actuator Limits: Left Lower, Right Lower</color>",

  "YangsThoughts": "The Night Wolf is a Clan Wolf Assault BattleMech produced by 3085 on Weingarten. The design was created by the Wolves as a practical means to deal with the new Combined Arms strategies employed by its opponents. The Night Wolf is meant as a replacement assault 'Mech for its second-line units which needed to replace the aging designs in their ranks. The 'Mech is not considered very fast, but its jump jets make it mobile enough to handle most contemporaries on the battlefield. Using a 360 Rated Extra Light Fusion Engine, the design is able to afford a large array of weaponry. Due to use of standard armor, its armor protection is considered to be less than other Clan 'Mechs. However, its 15.5 tons of armor coverage is considered strong enough for normal encounters. To help deal with more sophisticated electronics that may be employed against it, the 'Mech has been fitted with a Guardian ECM Suite.",
