    "Details": "The TR-XB is protected by 16 tons of Durallex Heavy Armor, with CASE embedded into its right torso. The 'Mech uses a XL 285-rated Fusion Engine as its source of power, to aid the 'Mech's ability to cope with a lack of rear-facing weapons and a modest top speed, the design was also given five Improved Jump Jets. The Trebaruna was designed to fight its opponents at long ranges, with its main weapon being its right torso-mounted Gauss Rifle, with 2 tons of ammunition, and supported by three Light PPC found in the opposite torso. These weapons are guided by a Targeting Computer located in the 'Mech's left torso. The Trebaruna is fitted with ten double heat sinks to help cope with its weapon and engine heat.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Quad Mech</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.17</color></b>",

  "YangsThoughts": "The Trebaruna is a Quad configured Assault BattleMech that was originally designed by the Word of Blake Protectorate. Production plans were canceled by the Word of Blake in 3078, when Allied Coalition forces were finally closing in on Terra. The design was discovered by Coalition members, and was offered to all the partners. The design was put into production by the Republic of the Sphere as part of its newly-formed armed forces in 3081, followed shortly after by the Marik-Stewart Commonwealth and Capellan Confederation.",
