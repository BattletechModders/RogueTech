    "Details": "Having dealt with years of incompatible systems with Clan-tech refits of the standard Beowulf, Odin built the Beowulf IIC from scratch in the hopes of avoiding them, only to use the same electronic systems which results in frequent glitches in combat. The main benefits of the switch to Clan-grade components was increased survivability for its 270-rated XL engine and the saving of half a ton through the use of Clan ferro-fibrous armor. Aside from that, the Beowulf IIC offers identical ground speed, bolstered by MASC, and jump distance as the ComStar BEO-12 model. The most notable and hotly contested change was the replacement of the Beagle active probe and TAG with a Watchdog CEWS and light TAG; while technically offering the same abilities with the added bonus of an ECM suite for less weight, the significantly reduced range forces the Beowulf IIC to put itself at much greater risk to fulfill its intended role. Similar to the ComStar original, the Beowulf IIC carries a right-arm mounted Series PPS-XX ER large pulse laser supported by a pair of left-arm mounted Series PPS-XIX ER medium pulse lasers. While doing more damage than the less advanced Inner Sphere weapons, the range brackets of the ComStar and Dominion models are almost identical, leading to further questions as to the value of the newer and more expensive design. \n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Extended Torso Twist</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.09</color></b>",

  "YangsThoughts": "Based on ComStar's Beowulf, the Beowulf IIC is a more advanced Clan-Tech version for the Ghost Bear Dominion. One of the many smaller manufacturers to emerge in the wake of the Clan Invasion, Odin Manufacturing's prospects soared with the Word of Blake Jihad and the Clan Ghost Bear takeover of the Free Rasalhague Republic. Flush from the success of the Karhu OmniMech and eager to make the 15-year-old Beowulf more profitable, Odin set about developing IIC style remake under its own initiative. Though the Ghost Bear touman's post-Jihad need for a fast medium Clan BattleMech to supplement the slower Ursus led them to buy the overly expensive Beowulf IIC, the fact the Dominion needed a fast medium OmniMech even more and that Odin was clearly engaging in blatant profiteering increasingly soured the integration of Rasalhagian and Ghost Bear arms manufacturing.",
