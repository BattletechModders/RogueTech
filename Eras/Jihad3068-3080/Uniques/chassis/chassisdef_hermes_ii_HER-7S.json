    "Details": "An experimental 'Mech ahead of its time, the HER-7S is the brainchild of Baron Roderick Axel of Lopez, who long believed he knew better than the military industrial complex how to develop an advanced upgrade of the Hermes II. Unfortunately, he was short on practical understanding of the true cost involved. Built on a composite internal structure, powered by a massive 320-rated XXL engine and clad in relatively low seven an half tons of armor, the HER-7S had a top speed of over 120 km/h and a 240 meter jump distance. Mounting 10 double heat sinks, an ER flamer, a Clan-spec large pulse laser, and a light PPC linked to a Clan-grade targeting computer, the 'Mech is a deadly combatant. However, due to the absurd expense and extreme fragility of the design, only three prototypes were manufactured, and in fact the whole proceedings seem to have been just a way for IBMU to use the Baron's money to gain more hands-on experience with the technologies involved.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Easy to Maintain</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.06</color></b>\n\n<br><br><color=#FFEF00>Arm Actuator Limit: Left Lower</color>",

  "YangsThoughts": "The Hermes II was first produced in 2798, based on the original Hermes BattleMech that had been used by the Star League. A heavy scout, the Hermes II boasted respectable weaponry, armoring, and speed, allowing it to easily brawl with lighter 'Mechs or survive an encounter with heavier 'Mechs and retreat. Out of all medium-weight 'Mechs at the time the Hermes II was the easiest to perform field maintenance on, leading to its nickname 'old reliable.' As combination scout and light strike platforms, Hermes II 'Mechs often operated alone, employed for missions for which lighter 'Mechs were too fragile and heavier 'Mechs too clumsy. The Hermes II was in its element when operating in a restrictive environment like a forest or city, where it could employ a most unusual tactic of setting its surroundings on fire to escape pursuit. Since most 'Mech pilots would naturally avoid a fire to prevent overheating and the flames interfered with most thermal scanners, starting a blaze allowed the Hermes II to more easily slip away.",
