    "Details": "This was an experimental variant produced by Scarborough Manufacturing Annex, designer Robert McMichaelson of Algedi in the 3070s. Designed to use experimental weaponry and equipment, it was intended become the next generation of the Pegasus in recon and harassment actions. The vehicle was fitted with a 210 XL fusion engine with a supercharger. This allowed the vehicle to achieve flank speed of 170 km/h and 220 km/h when the Supercharger is successfully engaged. Mounted in the turret, the vehicle has twin Diverse Optics Type 25PX Medium X-Pulse Lasers co-axially mounted with a Guided Technologies 2nd Generation Streak SRM-6 launcher. To enhance its spotting abilities, the vehicle has a C3 slave unit fitted. The hull is protected by 4.5 tons of ProtecTec 19 Heavy Ferro-Fibrous Armor. The Pegasus is a popular recon unit, due to its good speed, decent armor, and respectable firepower. It can be found in almost all militaries, having been introduced in the First Succession War and continuously updated ever since.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 11/17 Hex: 330/510 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Armor\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       120     20\n<b>Left</b>          80     20\n<b>Right</b>        80     20\n<b>Rear</b>         55     20\n<b>Turret</b>       80     20\n\n<b>Total</b>      415    100</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Improved Communications</color>",
