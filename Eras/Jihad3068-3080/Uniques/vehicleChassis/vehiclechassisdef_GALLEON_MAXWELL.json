    "Details": "A light combat vehicle that first saw production in 2692 the Galleon proved to be an economical means of supporting infantry and BattleMechs. With a top speed faster than most 'Mechs, the Galleon was mobile but generally lacked protection, early models carrying only three and a half tons of armor. After the Exodus, these tracked vehicles mostly fell into the possession of the Draconis Combine and the Free Worlds League. The Galleon is often paired with the Harasser Missile Platform. Developed by the Maxwell Planetary Defense Consortium, this Galleon variant uses some Experimental Technology to improve battlefield performance. Inclusion of a four-ton infantry bay allows the Galleon to carry a squad of battle armor equipped troopers.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Biome Restrictions: None.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 6/9 hexes / 180/270 meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Armor\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>        90     15\n<b>Left</b>          90     15\n<b>Right</b>        90     15\n<b>Rear</b>         90     15\n<b>Turret</b>       90     15\n\n<b>Total</b>      450     75</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Protected Mechanisms</color>\n\n<color=#ffcc00> Can carry 1 Battle Armor Squads.

  "YangsThoughts": "While the Galleon is about as ubiquitous of a vehicle as there is, but this Maxwell version is from a much rarer experimental limited run. It's up-gunned and its got a few rare upgrades like that Armored Motive System to protect the tracks.",
