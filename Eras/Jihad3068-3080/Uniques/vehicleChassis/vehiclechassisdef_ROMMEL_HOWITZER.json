    "Details": "This version of the Rommel removes the standard weaponry and replaces it with weapons that are allegedly easier for newer troops to use and less likely to fall victim to electronic warfare or Anti-Missile systems. The main gun is a Long Tom Artillery Cannon. This weapon can inflict massive amounts of damage on the target and its immediate surroundings and it doesn't require a great gunner. The LRM-5 was replaced by a Thunderbolt 5 launcher to provide more punch. The engine is an expensive XL model, later dropped to a standard for the production version. The Rommel tank is a 65-ton armored combat vehicle, specializing in close range fighting and urban combat. Identical to its twin, the Patton, in every way but armament and armor configuration, the Rommel has primarily served with the Lyran Commonwealth and the Lyran Alliance. It is named after Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, a legendary commander of armored and mechanized forces renowned for his exploits during World War II on Terra. The Rommel was designed concurrently with the Patton in the early 3000s, when Defiance Industries decided that an armored combat vehicle capable of replacing 'Mechs was needed. Since 'Mech production was nearly at a standstill, the ability to produce and field armored vehicles became a necessity for every Successor State.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 4/6 Hex: 120/180 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Heavy Ferro\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       285     35\n<b>Left</b>         245     35\n<b>Right</b>       245     35\n<b>Rear</b>        225     35\n<b>Turret</b>      245     35\n\n<b>Total</b>      1245    175\n</color>",
