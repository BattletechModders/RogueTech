It carries Heavy Ferro-Fibrous armor and a Guardian ECM Suite to protect itself, and trades in its main weaponry for a Heavy PPC The Rommel tank is a 65-ton armored combat vehicle, specializing in close range fighting and urban combat. Identical to its twin, the Patton, in every way but armament and armor configuration, the Rommel has primarily served with the Lyran Commonwealth and the Lyran Alliance. It is named after Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, a legendary commander of armored and mechanized forces renowned for his exploits during World War II on Terra. The Rommel was designed concurrently with the Patton in the early 3000s, when Defiance Industries decided that an armored combat vehicle capable of replacing 'Mechs was needed. Since 'Mech production was nearly at a standstill, the ability to produce and field armored vehicles became a necessity for every Successor State.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 4/6 Hex: 120/180 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Heavy Ferro\n<b>Structure:</b> Environmental Sealing\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       220     35\n<b>Left</b>         200     35\n<b>Right</b>       200     35\n<b>Rear</b>        130     35\n<b>Turret</b>      220     35\n\n<b>Total</b>      970    175\n</color>",
