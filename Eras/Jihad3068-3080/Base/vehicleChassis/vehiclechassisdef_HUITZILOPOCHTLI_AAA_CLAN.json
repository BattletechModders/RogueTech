    "Details": "The Huitzilopochtli, often referred to as the 'Huey,' is a Clan combat vehicle that was created as a mobile artillery platform. Kerensky's exiles brought few such vehicles with them, and most of the ones they did bring were destroyed during the Pentagon Civil War, so ilKhan Nicholas Kerensky authorized production of a design based on the Star League Defense Force's Padilla. The Clan disdain for both artillery and combat vehicles led the Huitzilopochtli to be built around an internal combustion engine, which can only propel it to 32 km/h. It is so slow that it is often moved by DropShip, prompting a questioning of what its designers considered 'mobile artillery.' Designers also skimped on armor protection, with a mere five and a half tons considered adequate for a unit that should be kilometers away from the battle. The Huey was again snubbed with the usage of standard armor, though an ECM Suite makes it difficult to locate and protects it from enemy electronics.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Biome Restrictions: None.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 2/3 hexes / 60/90 meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Armor (C)\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       170     45\n<b>Left</b>         130     45\n<b>Right</b>       130     45\n<b>Rear</b>        110     45\n<b>Turret</b>      120     45\n\n<b>Total</b>      660    225</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Improved Jammer</color>",
