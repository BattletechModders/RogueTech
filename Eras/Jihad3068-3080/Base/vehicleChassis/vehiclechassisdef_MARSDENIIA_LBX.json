    "Details": "A Jihad-era production variant of the Marsden II-A, this tank receives an infusion of modern weaponry. The tank's Strongarm Autocannon is swapped out for an LB-X Autocannon/10 with two tons of ammunition. The original II-A's SRM-6 is replaced with a pair of Streak SRM-2 launchers with two tons of ammunition mounted in the front of the vehicle. To add some protection from infantry, the tank again mounts two machine guns in the turret. The Marsden II Main Battle Tank was introduced by Arcturan Arms in 2463 to improve upon and replace its venerable predecessor after seventy years of frontline service. Not only did it share the name of the Lyran Commonwealth's late founding father with the Marsden I, but also its mission profile and much of its general layout. Improved technical and manufacturing knowledge stemming from Operation Prometheus allowed the company to improve the new tank's arms and armor while still making it five tons lighter. With its excellent firepower and thick armor, it was considered a cutting edge combat vehicle when it premiered during the Age of War. The durable Marsden II continued to soldier on in various planetary militias and private security force arsenals into the Succession Wars, where the last remaining units were finally destroyed.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>ICE: Air breathing Combustion Engine.
