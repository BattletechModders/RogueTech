    "Details": "This 3076 version replaces all the standard weaponry with a pair of Light PPCs which are mounted in the turret and an MML-3. It carries sufficient ammunition for extended battles. Entering service with the Lyran Commonwealth's military 3025, the Drillson is another example of the LCAF's preference for heavy vehicles. It's excellent performance during the Fourth Succession War established it as one of the best of its type. The Drillson is very heavy for a hover vehicle. Much of this weight is invested in protection. The Drillson relies mostly on the Cyclops Eye Large Laser based in its turret. This weapon and its associated fire control system were developed specifically for this vehicle by the ordnance division of Cyclops, Inc. This unconventional design uses a combination of laser energy and particle-beam technology. The unique structure of this system enables it to dispense with the relatively long barrels of standard large lasers.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 9/14 Hex: 270/420 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Armor\n<b>Structure:</b> Environmental Sealing\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       145     25\n<b>Left</b>         110     25\n<b>Right</b>       110     25\n<b>Rear</b>        100     25\n<b>Turret</b>      135     25\n\n<b>Total</b>      600    125\n</color>",
