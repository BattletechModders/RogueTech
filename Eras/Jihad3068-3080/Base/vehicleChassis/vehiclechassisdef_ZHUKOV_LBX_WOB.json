    "Details": "This 3073 variant changed the normal AC/10 for the LB-X version and the SRM is only a 4 tube version. The protection is increased through CASE and the unit is part of a C3i network. In 3030, Aldis Industries deployed the successful follow up to its venerable Demolisher design, the slightly lighter Zhukov. While it shares many of the parts and features of the design that inspired it, the Zhukov is smaller, better armored, and packs less weaponry than its predecessor. Its first major deployment was with the Wolf's Dragoons whereupon the Zhukov has since seen constant improvements and tweaks as suggested to Aldis Industries by the field units that use it. The Zhukov's strength is its relative simplicity. Two turret mounted SarLon MaxiCannon Autocannon/10s are more than adequate at providing sufficient firepower for the discriminating buyer while imitating its larger cousin the Demolisher.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>ICE: Air breathing Combustion Engine.
