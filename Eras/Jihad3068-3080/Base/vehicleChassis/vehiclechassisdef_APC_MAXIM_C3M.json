    "Details": "This version trades the ability to carry infantry for a C3 master computer. As the C3 Master can function as a TAG system, the turret-mounted TAG is also removed. To provide additional protection, the machine guns and ammunition of the standard Maxim are replaced by armor. Originally produced by Maxim Transport Industries, before a series of scandals led to its closure in 3039, the fast and heavily armed Maxim quickly became the model example of a transport throughout the Inner Sphere. Still produced via different companies, the Maxim is still heavily used by many units as their principal APC. It has proven itself popular both to unit commanders, who respect its firepower, speed and ability to carry a full platoon of infantry, and to the troops it carries, who respect its roomy, comfortable infantry bay. \n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Biome Restrictions: This unit can not deploy in Lunar or Martian biomes due to using an ICE.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 8/12 hexes / 240/360 meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Ferro-Fibrous\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       215     25\n<b>Left</b>         140     25\n<b>Right</b>       140     25\n<b>Rear</b>        100     25\n<b>Turret</b>      140     25\n\n<b>Total</b>      735    125</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Rugged</color>",
