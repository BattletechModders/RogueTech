    "Details": "The Word of Blake introduced an advanced Zhukov equipped with an Improved C3 Computer, a pair of Large Variable Speed Pulse Lasers, and a single MML-7. Additional armor and CASE protects the tank crew from ammunition explosions. To make room for all these changes this version is equipped with an XL Engine. In 3030, Aldis Industries deployed the successful follow up to its venerable Demolisher design, the slightly lighter Zhukov. While it shares many of the parts and features of the design that inspired it, the Zhukov is smaller, better armored, and packs less weaponry than its predecessor. Its first major deployment was with the Wolf's Dragoons whereupon the Zhukov has since seen constant improvements and tweaks as suggested to Aldis Industries by the field units that use it. The Zhukov's strength is its relative simplicity. Two turret mounted SarLon MaxiCannon Autocannon/10s are more than adequate at providing sufficient firepower for the discriminating buyer while imitating its larger cousin the Demolisher.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 4/6 Hex: 120/180 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Heavy Ferro\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       290     40\n<b>Left</b>         185     40\n<b>Right</b>       185     40\n<b>Rear</b>        120     40\n<b>Turret</b>      240     40\n\n<b>Total</b>      1020    200\n</color>",
