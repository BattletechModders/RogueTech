    "Details": "The 3079 production version of the HV Variant keeps the same weapons, but trades the fusion engine of the prototype for a Fuel Cell Engine. This reduces the weight of the engine and reduces the cost of the tank. To fill the weight left by the smaller engine, designers fitted an extra three and a half tons of Hardened Armor, bringing the total armor weight to fourteen tons. While often derided as a poor man's Rommel/Patton tank, the simply constructed and dependable Po Heavy Tank, named by Romano Liao for the mischievous and vengeful spirit of Chinese tradition, has become the principal combat vehicle on Capellan worlds lacking 'Mech units. Introduced in 3031, the Po is built around the rugged, dependable, and cheap Ceres 240 internal combustion engine, which gives the tank a maximum flank speed of 65 km/h. Ten and half tons of armor provides respectable protection for a heavy tank. Along with its ease of maintenance and decent firepower, this protection has made the Po a popular choice among cash strapped mercenaries, lower ranked garrison units, the Free Worlds League and Word of Blake, with such export sales keeping much needed funds flowing into the Confederation's coffers.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fuel Cell: Improved vehicle engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 4/6 Hex: 120/180 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Hardened\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       130     30\n<b>Left</b>         125     30\n<b>Right</b>       125     30\n<b>Rear</b>        100     30\n<b>Turret</b>      115     30\n\n<b>Total</b>      595    150</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Main Battle Tank</color>",
