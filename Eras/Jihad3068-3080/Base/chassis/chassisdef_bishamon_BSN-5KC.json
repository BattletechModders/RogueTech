    "Details": "Introduced during the Jihad, the BSN-5KC is designed to be a partner to the 4K by featuring a C3 slave unit in its head. The design retains two of the original medium pulse lasers in the side torsos, while the MRM-20 is exchanged for a more accurate snub-nose PPC, and a single ER medium laser has been added to the design to give it more long-range firepower. For defenses, the armor is slightly increased, while a Guardian ECM suite is installed to enhance protection from sophisticated weaponry.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Quad Mech</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.05</color></b>",

  "YangsThoughts": "The Bishamon is a quad BattleMech designed by Nimakachi Fusion Products Limited, which uses a mix of advanced construction techniques and advanced weapons systems to both save weight and make it as effective as possible on the battlefield. Officials had approached Nimakachi Fusion after the success of the Venom to build a larger design with newer technologies that had been introduced at the time. Nimakachi engineers originally intended for the Bishamon to have jump jets, however with a heavier weapons load the tradeoffs were enough to satisfy DCMS officials. Intended as a heavy scout, the Bishamon is built on a lightweight Endo Steel chassis and is powered by a 315 XL engine that gives it a ground speed of 118.8 km/h. While the Bishamon's high ground speed makes it a hard target to hit, the 'Mech carries 10.5 tons of Nimakachi Type 3 armor that provides adequate protection for the 'Mech's size. The Bishamon also has an extremely stable frame due to its quadrupedal chassis, at the expense of space available for weapons and equipment.",
