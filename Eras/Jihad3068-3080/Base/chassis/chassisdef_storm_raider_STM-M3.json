    "Details": "The STM-M3 is the original Defiance Industries design. The 'Mech was designed as a close quarters melee machine and premiered in Solaris VII's arena matches and as such its weapons configuration was modified on a customer by customer basis. The 'Mech was later seen in action on the battlefield after the crash of the HPG Network of 3132. The -M3 was armed with a single left arm mounted UAC/5, while its right arm permanently grasps its signature mace.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Melee Actuators</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.15</color></b>",

  "YangsThoughts": "Designed by Defiance Industries, the Storm Raider was intended to be an alternative to the Hollander light 'Mech. Unfortunately for Defiance, the Storm Raider was 50 years too late for the market, and the various prototypes were poorly received - so poorly received, in fact, that Defiance licensed all of the designs to Coventry Metal Works. Coventry Metal Works was manufacturing four different variants of the Storm Raider intended for use in urban defense roles or for small-scale surgical strikes, but the Storm Raider was a poor performer in both roles, outgunned by contemporaries and slower than most. Despite that, the Storm Raider proved an able fighter in the arenas at Solaris VII, where it became a fan favorite.",
