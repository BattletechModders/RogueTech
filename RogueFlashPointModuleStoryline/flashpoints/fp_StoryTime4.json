    "FlashpointShortDescription": "There's nothing sadder than a family that turns against each other. Well, maybe except for an empty glass. Buy me another round, will you? Anyway, when your family turns on you and wants to take a throne that's rightfully yours, well, that's called a coup. Yeah that's right, Duncan Fisher knows big words. So anyhow, it's only natural that you'd want to take back what was stolen. The Princess staged a jail break on Weldry to get back what was hers. Now get me that round and I'll tell you what happened!",
