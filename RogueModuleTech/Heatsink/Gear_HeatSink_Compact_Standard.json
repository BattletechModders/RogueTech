    "Details": "New Avalon Institute of Science had developed prototypes of so-called Compact Heat Sinks, with two single-strength compact heat sinks able to fit into the space of a one standard heat sink. Unfortunately much like the Compact Engine and Gyro, the use of denser but more compact materials increases the weight of each compact heat sink by half, generally restricting their use to heavier 'Mechs who have weight to spare.",
