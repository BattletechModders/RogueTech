Weapon Range Brackets, for that tag at the end of the def

close <= 90
standard <= 270
long <= 450
very long <= 630
extreme > 630

VALUE TO BE COMPARED IS LONG RANGE in the array NOT MAX.

Range Tags:

range_close
range_standard
range_long
range_very-long
range_extreme

General Weapon Notes:
By TT rules Maximum range is twice Medium Range
Clan weapons given baseline balance by being 25% hotter than their TT value.

All Small lasers are given +30 range to all normal brackets then max recalculated.
Flamers given same treatment as small lasers

Test Change:  Machine guns given +2 hexes, same range regardless of subtype.
    For their double weight HMG get 50% more damage and 50% more crit.
     Light mgs get 1 evasion ignore, +1 accuracy and no Recoil on a 4 shot burst.


Proper Changelog:

4/13/2020 - Cargo

Pruned redundant variants of all IS vanilla weapons.
    Deprecated variants removed from units, blacklisted and placed in a Vanilla No Loot folder
Did Balance/correction pass on remaining variants, standardizing and fixing their stats.
Moved our Prometheus flamer to quirk folder, it is currently unused and blacklisted.

4/7/2020 - Cargo

Set several medium laser variants to TT ranges, including clan Med pulses, we'll see how it shakes out.
Adjusted some IS med and large pulse variants to be more distinct, with either more or fewer pulses per shot.

---- 2/28/2020, Cargo_Vroom
Clan weapons set to lore ranges with the following exceptions

Not Touched because obvious balance issues
    Weapon_Gauss_Magshot_Clan <--
    Weapon_Flamer_Flamer_CLAN <----more range but also falloff?
    Weapon_Laser_Light_TAG_CLAN <---- Just so different
    Machine guns <---- We buffed them a lot, might need a look but skipped for now.
        Clan MG ranges and niches handled same as IS ones now. - Cargo, 4/5/2020

    Clan Medium Pulse because it's a god weapon on TT because reasons.

Things Touched but not set to canon:
    STUPID CLAN SMALL AND MICRO LASERS BECAUSE THE OFFICIAL VERSIONS MAKE NO SENSE.
    Set so ER's are longer than standard/pulse
    Set so pulses are shorter range than normal or ER in same bracket.

    -----End 2/28/2020 note----
