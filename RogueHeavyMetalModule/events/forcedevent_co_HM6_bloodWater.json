The bad news is, we're not the only company on the derelict's trail. The [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreBlackWidow],Black Widow]] has been carving a bloody trail across the Frontier, burning out black market sites on over a dozen worlds. And I have reliable information that she's moving toward Mantharaka.\"\r\n\r\nSumire shakes her head. \"If we fight the Black Widow, she's gonna end us. This is a bad idea, Commander.\"\r\n\r\nFarah shrugs. \"So we move fast. If we recover the <i>Dobrev</i>'s navigation logs before she gets there, we won't even need to fight.\"",
