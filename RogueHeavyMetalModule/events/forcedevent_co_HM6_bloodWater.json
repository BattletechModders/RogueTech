Her surviving crew was medevaced to an orbiting station, where they were all found to have suffered misjump-induced injuries.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreDobrev],<i>Dobrev</i>]]!\" Farah pumps her fist, her smile radiant with triumph. \"It has to be!\"\r\n\r\nDarius nods. \"Yes, and that was the good news. The bad news is, we're not the only company on the derelict's trail. The [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreBlackWidow],Black Widow]] has been carving a bloody trail across the Frontier, burning out black market sites on over a dozen worlds. And I have reliable information that she's moving toward Mantharaka.\"\r\n\r\nSumire shakes her head. \"If we fight the Black Widow, she's gonna end us. This is a bad idea, Commander.\"\r\n\r\nFarah shrugs. \"So we move fast. If we recover the <i>Dobrev</i>'s navigation logs before she gets there, we won't even need to fight.\"",
