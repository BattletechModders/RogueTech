9cb58ede19f6fedffa298ff9"«Greetings Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}. We've a most pressing and difficult issue that requires us to hire an outside mercenary company. You see a local pirate band has taken up residence on our peaceful little planet in an old military facility. They are using it to stage raids on our citizens and to smuggle illegal goods. We'd take care of them ourselves. But we don't have battlemechs strong enough to face their forces.*¡
