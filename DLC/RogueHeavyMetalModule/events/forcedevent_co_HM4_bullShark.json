What we've got is one third of a mothballed assault 'Mech—mostly the guts, so it doesn't look like much to the untrained eye. But what I can tell you is that this 'Mech is <i>strange</i>. Never seen anything quite like it.\"\r\n\r\nFarah raises her hand. \"And I think I have a lead on the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreDobrev],<i>Dobrev</i>]]. An old colleague of mine contacted me about a group of patients at the hospital she administrates. They were suffering from what appeared to be [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMisjump],misjump]]-induced injuries. I think it's worth investigating.\" \r\n\r\nSumire rubs her temples. \"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I've got one, too. A [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreJumpShip],JumpShip]] operator I used to hang with has been running his mouth about a big job he just did for Notker Baumann. Want me to follow up?\"",
