I say we take our pound of flesh, and an extra pound for our troubles!\"\r\n\r\nDarius shakes his head. \"I can't believe I'm suggesting walking away from C-Bills, but If we allow Yamaguchi to save face here, we could gain a significant boost in our reputation with Kurita.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Murad clears her throat and pauses, holding the room's attention. \"Remember how the Shugo delegated the contract to his [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreGakuHironaka],underling]], so he could rush off to Herotitus? The notorious pleasure planet?\" She pauses again before adding,  \"Do you think we could get some leverage from that?\"",
