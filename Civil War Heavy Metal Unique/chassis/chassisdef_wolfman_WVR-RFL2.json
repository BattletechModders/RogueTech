Fortunately, a Davion Rifleman had been destroyed only a hundred meters away from his 'Mech. The Rifleman had suffered damage to its torso and legs. Ullman's personal technician, Sharis Brand thought that the two 'Mechs could be merged together, taking the intact legs and hips from Ullman's Wolverine and combining it with the torso and arms from the Rifleman.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Ubiquitous</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.05</color></b>",
