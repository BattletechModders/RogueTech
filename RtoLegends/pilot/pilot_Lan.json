    "Details": "Lan Leonhart was born to poor family on the war ravaged world of Caph. With raids on the world commonplace during those years, Lan's parents were killed when an aerospace fighter was shot down and crashed in the neighbourhood where its munitions detonated on impact, leveling the area. Lan only narrowly survived by happening to be at a park just outside the area. Now an orphan, Lan learned how to survive and fight, whether it be for food, a place to sleep or against house troops trying to tame the population.\n\nConsidering no successor lord as a friend of him or the people at large, Lan eventually caught the attention of a visiting comguard commander after watching the adolescent single-handedly ambush an infantry patrol of Capellan raiders for their rations. Taking the young Lan under his wing, the nameless commander saw great promise in the troubled youth.\n\nLan proved to be a quick study and found himself soon attending a comguard academy on Terra. There, Lan was steeped in the history of the long dead Terran Hegemony and learned that his family had once been a powerful member of the Hegemony's noble elite, brought low by the Amaris Civil war and the subsequent collapse of the Star League.\n\nWithin a decade of graduation, Lan had risen to command one of the ComGuard's most prestigious units, 5 years later Lan was promoted to the rank of Precentor Martial where he excelled at advancing Comstar's goals. 8 years after his promotion, Lan was promoted one last time when he was named Primus.\n\nAs Primus, Lan set about enacting his agenda to rebuild the Terran Hegemony under Comstar's banner. Despite the odds, Lan succeeded in making Comstar not only a soft power with its control over the HPG network, but also one with the military muscles to contend with any nation that dared cross his path. \n\nWhile some may consider him brash and arrogant, even his most hated enemies will admit that he is a force to be reckoned with. With his experience on the streets, Lan is not afraid to use unconventional tactics or under-handed moves to advance his quest to rebuild the Hegemony. Some question if he succeeds, if he will then attempt to rebuild the Star League, however this seems to be an answer that only Lan himself knows, and he certainly isn't telling.\n",
