Unsurprisingly, the headstrong, naive young man lost his ‘Mech, and finally, his misplaced pride. Life had slapped him in the face, and now that his eyes were open to reality, he felt humble, and wished for nothing more than to actually earn himself a spot among a real Mercenary command, and a chance to really earn that which was unfairly bought.",

That sort of work suited her tastes, and the criminal aspects of things started to fall to the wayside. The other pirates noticed, and not wanting to lose their share of her bounty takes, they offered her a spot among the few 'Mech jocks they had. She was put at the controls of a primitive, derelict Shadow Hawk, and her eye for killing only grew sharper.

Raised in the Outback of the Federated Suns, she learned quickly that one man’s junk was another man’s treasure. Parts and supply could be hard to find in the wilder parts of the Suns, and so many learned to re-jigger, reuse, and recycle. Toni enjoyed tinkering with all manner of devices, and her family had an oddly rich history in technology. Her grandfather had worked building Nissan 200s for the Enforcer, and he took that knowledge with them when the lot of them were forced to move after he lost his job at the fusion engine plant. Unfortunately he passed on in transit to their new home, but the Okoyes kept all his manuals and notes, and Toni’s mother and father both took jobs in repair and maintenance once the family re-settled.\r\n\r\nToni learned about ‘Mechs the same way a lot of people in the rougher parts of the Inner Sphere do; she got lucky. The garrison on her world had a chassis in need of an engine, and as it happened, Toni managed to blunder into one, get it working, and install it into the decrepit Enforcer 4R, giving the ‘Mech it’s first hum of life in a hundred years. A thankful local government let her train in it under the Dispossessed Mechwarrior they'd hired to pilot it for the militia, and before long the dream of being a real Mechwarrior took root. It didn’t help that the Mechwarrior Toni was learning from filled her head with stories of battles and victory, and it wasn’t long before she decided to market herself to any Mercenary company passing through as a two-for-one Tech and pilot deal; after all, and the budget-conscious might appreciate an extra hand in the Mechbay. However solid her skills with a wrench are, the aesthetics of her work often leave something to be desired, and it’s not uncommon for the Chief Tech of her outfit to wonder why the leg of the CO's ride looks like it lost a fight with a junkpile.",

      "original": "Born on Terra, Adam joined ComStar as an Acolyte at a young age. After years of training on Terra, he then continued to serve the Blessed Blake as a HPG technician on a fairly backwater world in the Taurian Concordat know as Argos (as happens with new acolytes, they have to learn somewhere).  For several years he labored at his duties without much distinction or notice.\r\n\r\nNear the close of the 3rd Succession War, the HPG station was attacked by a group of extremely bold (if not more than a little stupid) pirates.  ComStar put out a call to the local militia while their meager security force held the pirates at bay as best as they could.  However, the pirates soon overwhelmed the ComStar base, and several pirates exited their vehicles to begin looting the compound.  It was at this moment that Adam's life took a turn.  Making a rash decision to do whatever it took to protect the blessed HPG and technology of old, Adam climbed into a vacated 'Mech and powered it up.  Despite a lack of actual training, he found that the controls matched the simulation pods that he enjoyed playing with in his off hours.  With his purloined 'Mech lurching into motion he managed some lucky shots, destroying a pirate APC Transport and crippling two tanks.  He even managed to knock over one of their Stinger Light 'Mechs as he careened off the side in an ungainly attempt at a charge.  Between this unexpected resistance, and the sudden appearance of the local militia, the tide was turned and the pirates were soon in full retreat.\r\n\r\nWith the battle over, the Precentor in charge of the HPG noted Adam's deeds and encouraged him to walk the missionary's path, believing that Blessed Blake had a higher purpose in mind for him.  Adam was to learn the way of the MechWarrior, while also spreading the Word of Blake amongst the stars and searching out other like minded warriors of faith.

After years of training on Terra, he then continued to serve the Blessed Blake as a HPG technician on a fairly backwater world in the Taurian Concordat know as Argos (as happens with new acolytes, they have to learn somewhere).  For several years he labored at his duties without much distinction or notice.\r\n\r\nNear the close of the 3rd Succession War, the HPG station was attacked by a group of extremely bold (if not more than a little stupid) pirates.  ComStar put out a call to the local militia while their meager security force held the pirates at bay as best as they could.  However, the pirates soon overwhelmed the ComStar base, and several pirates exited their vehicles to begin looting the compound.  It was at this moment that Adam's life took a turn.  Making a rash decision to do whatever it took to protect the blessed HPG and technology of old, Adam climbed into a vacated 'Mech and powered it up.  Despite a lack of actual training, he found that the controls matched the simulation pods that he enjoyed playing with in his off hours.  With his purloined 'Mech lurching into motion he managed some lucky shots, destroying a pirate APC Transport and crippling two tanks.  He even managed to knock over one of their Stinger Light 'Mechs as he careened off the side in an ungainly attempt at a charge.

There he excelled in his tactics classes and was put on a fast track for being assigned to a line unit to replace the ever increasing losses during the 3rd Succession War.  Being given an early commission with the severely depleted Sixth Arcturian Guards, Garrison was sent to Starshine at the age of 21.\r\n\r\nOn Starshine he was assigned to be First Leutnant of a Support Lance where he was able to make excellent use of his academy training against pirate raiders and Free Worlds League units.  Where is Starshine you may ask?  Well, don't bother looking for it on star maps, its a dead world now.  What about the Sixth Arcturian Guards?  They no longer show on the rolls of active units for the Commonwealth - yet Garrison was there at the end of both.\r\n\r\nBarely a year into his new assignment, Garrison was thrust right into action.  During the Marik Civil War of 3014 (also known as Anton's Revolt), the Commonwealth decided to take advantage of the situation and sent the Sixth in to raid Griffith.  With the chaos of Anton's Revolt, the 1st Fusiliers of Oriente were slow to respond and the Sixth's raid was considered a rousing success.  During the fighting Garrison would bait the enemy into terrain of his choosing to allow his support lance to pepper the opposing force with indirect fire while performing slow withdrawals toward the other lances in his company.  The Hauptmann of the company took to saying the OpFor got 'Garrisoned' and it wasn't long before it stuck as his call sign.\r\n\r\nReturning to their post at Starshine, the Sixth was celebrating their victory in one of the larger domed habitats when the Fusiliers got their revenge.  Performing a Hover-Drop, a mobile force of Fusiliers attacked, catching the Sixth completely unaware.  Scrambling to get back to his 'Mech, Garrison found he was cut off by the Fusiliers' forces.  Over the next few days he bided his time until opportunity knocked in he form of a Fusiliers Hunchback 4P that was left in the old Sixth depot area for repairs.  Subduing the technicians, Garrison took control of the 'Mech and made to escape the depot.  There are many stories about what happened next, but the one thing every story has in common is that the depot was set off, causing a chain reaction that destroyed the Star League era air purifying system that kept the planetary domes habitable.

During a strafing run by a Black Raider AeroSpace Fighter, a freak accident occurred with the restraint system in the MechBay and the LRM pods in the Hunchback triggered, and it seemed that the techs had forgotten to remove the load during the frenzy to get off world.  The explosion caused a systematic failure resulting in the loading bay door opening, and all unsecured equipment was blown into space, including Garrison's HBK-4P.

While the DropShip was able to escape, Garrison was now without a unit, without a world and without a 'Mech.\n\nConsidering his past and knowing that both the world and unit he last served on have passed from existence, many believe Garrison to be jinxed, and considering how he wound up dispossessed and in the hiring halls, maybe there is something to it. But Garrisoned is a skilled Tactician and he has a plan to get back in the game, even if he has had to take his lumps as a merc for nearly a decade.",

His father was a noble diplomat from the Lyran Commonwealth and his mother a prominent officer in the New Avalon Crucis March Militia.  Their relationship was initially viewed with suspicion by factions within both Houses and life was difficult for Evan as he grew up between worlds.  Ironically, years later his family would be lauded as an important step in the improving relations between the two realms.  But this would not be in time to make Evan's life any easier.\r\n\r\nFrom a very early age Evan showed an aptitude for VR combat simulation games, often taking units known to be under powered, yet somehow finessing them to victory.  This eventually led him to seek a career with the military much to his mother's delight and father's grudging tolerance.  He was soon enrolled at the newly formed NAIS, but life there was no picnic, as all his classmates believed him to be there on his parent's accomplishments and not his own merits.  Never the less, Evan was determined to prove himself, and would never back down from a challenge.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating, his mother offered to help him gain a position in the March Militia, but Evan continued to want to forge his own destiny.  Accepting a junior officer position with the 33rd Avalon Hussars, he left New Avalon behind, yet the spectre of his family continued to follow him.\r\n\r\nAlways a risk taker, Evan found he much preferred the role of scout, both for the solitude and the opportunities it provided him to show what he could accomplish.  Through sheer determination he rose to the rank of Leftenant, but he still wanted a chance to step out from his parent's shadow.  Soon he would have his chance in spades.\r\n\r\nIn 3022 the 33rd was part of an expedition to retake Galtor III from the Draconis Combine, in what became known as one of the bloodiest campaigns in the later part of the 3rd Succession War.  During that campaign, Leftenant Zanos' lance was instrumental in scouting out the enemy forces, helping the Federated Suns to eventually retake Galtor.  However, during the campaign, Evan felt for the people of Galtor III, who were suffering horrendous loses.  It was during a information gathering mission that Evan saw the atrocities being committed by the Combine Troops on the citizenry, and despite orders not to reveal themselves, Evan took maters into his own hands, attacking the DCMS forces.  The sheer bravado and wildness of the attack threw the Combine Soldiery into disarray, and believing that Lt. Zanos' lance was a spearhead for a larger force they withdrew.  While he had saved these poor souls, what he saw that day caused him to resign his commission and seek ways to help the people.",
