The AC/20 is replaced with an LRM-20 and 2 tons of ammo, while 2 medium lasers are added to the mech; for improved mid range efficiency. Cheaper and easier to maintain then the expensive AC versions, the LRMbie is proving surprisingly popular amongst it's pilots. The longer reach of the LRM pairs better with it's slower ground speed and has led to claims that it improves the mechs survivability rates in combat situations. With Helm Core technology becoming increasingly widespread, many owners plan to mate the LRM with the increasing range of speciality munitions, creating an effective support mech that can provide everything from mine laying capability to indirect fire support in a cheap package. A number of examples are known to have been obtained by various manufactures, who are keen to experiment with the design.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: 360° Torso Twist</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 0.97</color></b>",
