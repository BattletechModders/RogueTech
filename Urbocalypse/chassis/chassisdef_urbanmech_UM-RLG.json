Under their direction, a Chameleon LPS system was incorporated into the design, along with a TAG system for target spotting. Sacrificing some armour to include the added bulk of the stealth systems, this Urbie makes a surprisingly good sniper with 3 jump jets providing the mobility it needs to move around and the LPS allowing it to sit for days at a time unnoticed, until the target walks past. The inclusion of the LPS was considered to expensive by the Chief Armour and the project was subsequently cancelled with only 3 prototypes made; all of which disappeared into the hands of SAFE. <b><color=#53ff1a>Restricted Actuators- Left: Upper, Right: Upper</color></b>",
