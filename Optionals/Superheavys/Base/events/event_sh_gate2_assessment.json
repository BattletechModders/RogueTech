You can hear some faint muttering as the Assessor disappears out of view.</color> \"Hmph, lucky for them I don't have the time to waste on this pile of scrap today.\" <color=#A8A8A8>Looking down at the document, you see it is the confirmation of being approved for Omega authorization. You can feel the tension drain out of your shoulders as you turn around towards Darius, waving the document happily.</color>",

Visit the Engineering view for more details.\n\nThis upgrade enables <b>Hunt</b> Contracts, which are the highest tier of Superheavy Contracts and amongst the hardest in Roguetech. They will be considerably harder than normal contracts due to the large amount of advanced and superheavy units combined with ace AI pilots. The difficulty of the opposing forces will however scale according to the Company's difficulty rating (skulls) as per normal.\n\nBefore attempting a Hunt contract, it is recommended to have a very capable drop force able to handle sustained fighting as Superheavy units usually are considerably more durable. To make the difficulty manageable the Hunt contracts will allow increased drop tonnage based on contract difficulty, up to 1220 tons.\n\nFor more information see the dedicated page to <b>Superheavy Contracts</b> on the Roguetech wiki.</color>"
