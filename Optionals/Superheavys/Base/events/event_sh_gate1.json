It has finally happened, we got an offer for upgraded authorization from the MRB.\"<color=#A8A8A8>He hands his techpad over, an incoming message already open.</color>\n\n\"<i>Dear Commander {COMMANDER.Name} of {COMPANY.CompanyName},\n\nIt is with great pleasure the MRB can inform You that Your company is now able to request an increased contract classification authorization within the MRB contract bidding system.\n\nFor a small nominal fee, the MRB will provide one of its most experienced assessors; who after a routine assessment of your company's capabilities will allow the requisition of an upgraded official <b>MRB Epsilon Authorization Console</b>.\n\nThis upgrade will allow Your company to take on even harder contracts, opening the path to even more glory and fortunes!\n\nWe hope to hear from you shortly, [TEMPLATE_Generic_Insert Name of Friendly Local MRB Representative].</i>\"\n\n<color=#A8A8A8>Darius waits impatiently until you finish reading the message.</color> \"What are we waiting for, let's request the assessment at once. Imagine the increased amount of fame I..*cough* we will achieve once it is known we can handle Epsilon-level contracts!\" <color=#A8A8A8>You shake your head at the almost-bouncing Darius, but decided to look into the matter later in the day.</color>\n\n\n<b><color=#35dde0>Information:</b> The access to Superheavy Mission contracts can now be unlocked.  These missions are <b>considerably</b> harder as they will include one or more Superheavy 'Mechs or vehicles, which each can weigh up to 200 tons, depending on your current difficulty rating.</color>",
