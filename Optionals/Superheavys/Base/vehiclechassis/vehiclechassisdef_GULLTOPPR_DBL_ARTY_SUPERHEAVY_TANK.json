    "Details": "The Gulltoppr OmniMonitor is a thirty-second century superheavy OmniVehicle. It was first produced for the Lyran Commonwealth and Clan Wolf-in-Exile as a defensive garrison unit. The Gulltoppr was designed and manufactured by Clan Wolf-in-Exile on Arc-Royal in 3102, the unit was mass produced to help fill up worlds on the Clan border. Gulltoppr are mammoth machines that are noted for their impressive firepower and armor, but their slow speeds keeps them from being anything more than a defensive combat unit. Designed to serve as a command vehicle, the B features two C3 boosted master computers and a Guardian ECM suite. The B's weaponry features only two Long Tom Cannons, with one gun in each of its turrets and eight tons of ammo total.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 2/3 Hex: 60/90 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Hardened\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       470    133\n<b>Left</b>         365    133\n<b>Right</b>       365    133\n<b>Rear</b>        280    133\n<b>Turret</b>      290    133\n\n<b>Total</b>      1770    665</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Battle Computer B2000</color>\n\n<color=#ffcc00> Omni Vehicle</color>",
