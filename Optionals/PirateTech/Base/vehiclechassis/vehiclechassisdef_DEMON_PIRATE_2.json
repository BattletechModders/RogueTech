    "Details": "Pirates apparently tried to build their version of the old SLDF Royal Demon. The weapons are all weird off-spec versions, but are functionally pretty similar. However, it's top speed is only about 65 kph instead of the Royal's 85 kph. The Demon was originally created by the SLDF as its standard fighting vehicle in 2716. A match for any light or medium BattleMech, the Demon had good maneuverability and was protected by ten tons of slab armor, most of it concentrated in its front. Due to the nature of its powerful main weapon the Demon was often used in ambush attacks and fought in pairs instead of the usual four-vehicle lance. The vehicle's main disadvantage was its lack of speed, which made it vulnerable to faster 'Mechs and other vehicles able to maneuver around and engage its weaker rear armor.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 4/6 Hex: 120/180 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Reflective Coating\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       250     30\n<b>Left</b>         170     30\n<b>Right</b>       170     30\n<b>Rear</b>        100     30\n<b>Turret</b>      150     30\n\n<b>Total</b>      840    150\n</color>",
