    "Details": "The Marsden II Main Battle Tank was introduced by Arcturan Arms in 2463 to improve upon and replace its venerable predecessor after seventy years of frontline service. Not only did it share the name of the Lyran Commonwealth's late founding father with the Marsden I, but also its mission profile and much of its general layout. Improved technical and manufacturing knowledge allowed the company to improve the new tank's arms and armor while still making it five tons lighter. With its excellent firepower and thick armor, it was considered a cutting edge combat vehicle when it premiered during the Age of War. The durable Marsden II continued to soldier on in various planetary militias and private security force arsenals into the Succession Wars.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>ICE: Air breathing Combustion Engine.
