    "Details": "What is this mishmash of Doering Electronics' HPCS and salvaged targeting computers? Talk about a recipe for disaster! Just look at this \"pirate neural interface\" â€” more like a \"not fit for a gerbil\" interface. You'd have better luck using a rusty spoon to target your weapons. And what's worse, it's designed to intentionally cannibalize the equipment around it on failure. Whoever thought this contraption was a good idea was swigging way too much space grog. If you're willing to bet a MechWarrior's hide on this heap, be my guest, but don't say I didn't warn you.",
