Anyone?  Well, let me tell you what we found...\"\r\n\r\nYang, trying hard to keep a straight face, blurts out, 'frozen [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreTacoTruck],Taco Truck Mince]]'...\"\r\n\r\nDarius looks straight at Yang, \"You arranged this, didn't you!?\"\r\n\r\nYang is now grinning like a Canopian Cat Girl, \"That stuff is more <i>gold</i> than even [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreTripleFBurger],Triple-F Burger]] meat!  Do you know how rare this stuff is to acquire?\"\r\n\r\nDr. Murad sits up, an interested look on her face, \"Please tell me that you know what to do with this stuff.  We do not need another MedBay incident.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shouldn't be a problem Doc.  Taco Truck franchises are all mobile, so their mince is designed to be moved about all the time.  As long as the galley has all the spices, we will be in Taco Heaven! â€” my team will take care of the goods and [[TRT_MW,{TRT_MW.Callsign}]] wants to help me.\" Yang flashes you a winning smile. \"In fact, I know someone else who's family actually started Taco Truck.  If we ever bump into him, do not hesitate to employ him as we'll then have the best tacos you have ever tasted!  What do you say, Commander? You want some tacos on the menu?\"",

Their XO was <i>desperate</i> to take the mince off our hands, to stave off a mutiny because the closest one was outside of their contract zone.\"\r\n\r\nYang slams his fist on the table. \"See!
