Nice to see you again, I trust things have been well?\"\r\n\r\nYou let out a short laugh, \"They were, until you called.  Your so-called 'game' by the way, is so one-sided it's a joke.  What is it you want this time?\"\r\n\r\n<i>Front Man</i> smiles, \"I am beginning to really like you, Commander!.  Anyways, back to the reason I have contacted you.  Please accept my apologies for interrupting you yet again, but you seem to have employed yet another individual who owes me over Â¢1,000,000.  If you would please remand [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] over to me and I will be on my way.\"\r\n\r\nYou look at the screen, \"So I am to just take your word that [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] owes you this money?  Even after all this time we do not even know who you really are!\"\r\n\r\n<i>Front Man</i> smiles at you, \"You can ask [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] yourself and should they choose to lie to you, not only will I be able to show you proof, you will have an indicator of the type of person they really are.\"\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] turns to you, \"Commander, he speaks the truth.  I have been running from them for a long time and if it wasn't for you and {COMPANY.CompanyName}, they would have found me a lot sooner.  I cannot drag you into this so if they are now willing to wipe my debt AND reward you at the same time, then count me in!\"\r\n\r\nYou address <i>Front Man</i>, \"So, you wish [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] to participate in another one of your games?\"\r\n\r\n<i>Front Man</i> steeples his fingers in front of him, \"Yes, Commander, it is as simple as allowing [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] to play in the game.  As you know, winning the game will result in {SCN_MW.DET} debt being wiped and your company will receive a crate of <i>'goodies'</i>.\"\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] yells out, \"Count me...\" You quickly interrupt {SCN_MW.DET}, \"The game uses the same odds as last time I presume?\"\r\n\r\n<i>Front Man</i> smiles deliciously, \"Nothing has changed from before aside from the contestants.  Also, should [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] fail in achieving victory, their debt will be paid in a more permanent manner.  Of course, you could just pay their debt instead.\"\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] grabs your arm, spinning you around, \"Commander, I cannot keep running from them, and I don't want to be indebted to you more than I already am.  I can win whatever 'game' they have planned.  Let me do this!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your decision, Commander?\" says <i>Front Man</i>.",
