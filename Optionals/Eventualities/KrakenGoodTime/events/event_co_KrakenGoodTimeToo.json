Nice to see you again, I trust things have been well?\"\r\n\r\nYou let out a short laugh, \"They were, until you called.  Your so-called 'game' by the way, is so one-sided it's a joke.  What is it you want this time?\"\r\n\r\n<i>Front Man</i> smiles, \"I am beginning to really like you, Commander!.  Anyways, back to the reason I have contacted you.  Please accept my apologies for interupting you yet again, but you seem to have employed yet another individual who owes me over \u00A21,000,000.  If you would please remand [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] over to me and I will be on my way.\"\r\n\r\nYou look at the screen, \"So I am to just take your word that [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] owes you this money?  Even after all this time we do not even know who you really are!\"\r\n\r\n<i>Front Man</i> smiles at you, \"You can ask [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] yourself and should they choose to lie to you, not only will I be able to show you proof, you will have an indicator of the type of person they really are.\"\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] turns to you, \"Commander, he speaks the truth.  I have been running from them for a long time and if it wasn't for you and {COMPANY.CompanyName}, they would have found me a lot sooner.  I cannot drag you into this so if they are now willing to wipe my debt AND reward you at the same time, then count me in!\"\r\n\r\nYou address <i>Front Man</i>, \"So, you wish [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] to participate in another one of your games?\"\r\n\r\n<i>Front Man</i> steeples his fingers in front of him, \"Yes, Commander, it is as simple as allowing [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] to play in the game.  As you know, winning the game will result in {SCN_MW.DET} debt being wiped and your company will receive a crate of <i>'goodies'</i>.\"\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] yells out, \"Count me...\" You quickly interupt {SCN_MW.DET}, \"The game uses the same odds as last time I presume?\"\r\n\r\n<i>Front Man</i> smiles deliciously, \"Nothing has changed from before aside from the contestants.  Also, should [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] fail in achieving victory, their debt will be paid in a more permanent manner.  Of course, you could just pay their debt instead.\"\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] grabs your arm, spinning you around, \"Commander, I cannot keep running from them, and I don't want to be indebted to you more than I already am.  I can win whatever 'game' they have planned.  Let me do this!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your decision, Commander?\" says <i>Front Man</i>.",
