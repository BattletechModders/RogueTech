Nice to see you again, I trust things have been well?\"\r\n\r\nYou look at <i>Front Man</i>, \"Seriously?  I lost a damned good pilot to your <i>Game</i> last time!  I know why you are contacting me, so get to the point.  Which of my crew owes you money this time?\"\r\n\r\n<i>Front Man</i> smiles, \"Ah, direct and to the point, I knew there was a reason I liked you {COMMANDER.LastName}.  Very well then.  You currently employ [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] and yes, they owe us more than Â¢1,000,000, which is now overdue.  We must insist that debt is paid in full.  Allow [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] to participate in the <i>Game</i> and we can put this matter behind us all.\"\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] turns to you, \"Commander, if they are still willing to wipe my debt AND reward us at the same time, I am all in!\"\r\n\r\nYou turn to [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]], \"You can DIE, man!\"\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] stands up straight, \"I am tired of hiding Commander.\"\r\n\r\nYou sigh, and turn to address <i>Front Man</i>, \"Your proposal the same as last time we spoke?\"\r\n\r\n<i>Front Man</i> steeples his fingers in front of him, \"Absolutely.  I will restate it now to avoid any confusion.  My employer asks that [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] plays in a game.  Winning the game will result in {SCN_MW.DET} debt being wiped and your company will receive a crate of <i>'goodies'</i>.  Should [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] fail in achieving victory, their debt will be paid in a more permanent manner.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your decision, Commander?\" says <i>Front Man</i>.",
