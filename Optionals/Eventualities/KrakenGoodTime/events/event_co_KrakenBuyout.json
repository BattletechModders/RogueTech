Nice to see you again, I trust things have been well?\"\r\n\r\nYou cross your arms in front of you, \"What do you want this time <i>Front Man</i>?\"\r\n\r\n<i>Front Man</i> smiles, \"You realy should have someone properly vet your crew.  You have another in your employ that owes us money.  You know them as [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]], and they owe us more than ¢1,000,000.  Allow [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] to participate in the <i>Game</i> and we can put this matter behind us all.  Or you can buyout their marker like you did last time we were in this predicament.\"\r\n\r\nYou look at the screen, \"So I am to just take your word that [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] owes you this money?  How do I know that you are not just trying to extort my company?\"\r\n\r\n<i>Front Man</i> looks at you, \"Commander, you have resources to check up on each and every one of your crew.  In fact, you already know that [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] has a criminal background, yet you chose to hire them anyways, and now here we are, again.\"\r\n\r\nYou start to respond but <i>Front Man</i> continues speaking, \"I present the same offer I did last time.  You may choose to decline the invitation, in which case we will implement whatever means necessary to either recoup our money from [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]], or... well, we wouldn't want to spoil the surprise now would we?\"\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] turns to you, \"Commander, I told you they would keep looking for me.  If they are still willing to wipe my debt AND reward us at the same time, I am all in!\"\r\n\r\nYou address <i>Front Man</i>, \"So, your proposal is EXACTLY the same as last time we spoke?  Repeat it to me now.\"\r\n\r\n<i>Front Man</i> steeples his fingers in front of him, \"Absolutely.  My employer asks that [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] plays in a game.  Winning the game will result in {SCN_MW.DET} debt being wiped and your company will receive a crate of <i>'goodies'</i>.  Should [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] fail in achieving victory, their debt will be paid in a more permanent manner.  You can also opt to buyout their marker as well.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your decision, Commander?\" says <i>Front Man</i>.",
