[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] looks at them, then their weapons, and reluctantly enters the room.\r\n\r\nThe room, is more of a small cubicle, with no windows, only one door, a bed, basin, mirror and toilet.  \r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] slumps on the bed and mutters, \"I guess this is where I will be staying until this is over... or I die.\"\r\n\r\nThe voice sounds over the comms, <color=#D4AF37>\"All players, the next round will begin tomorrow.

A small point on the mirror begins to glow and the edges around the glow blacken, then a ruby beam of light bursts forth striking [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] directly in the chest.\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]]'s head jerks back, pain etched across {SCN_MW.OBJ} face, before {SCN_MW.OBJ} eyes flutter and close, head slumping forward.  The mirror fades to clear glass, showing another player in the same situation as [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]].  The difference being that <color=#D4AF37><i>Player 187</i></color> has a shocked look on their face, which changes to relief in knowing that they are not dead.\r\n\r\nThe comms activate again, <color=#D4AF37>\"Player 203, eliminated.  Player 187 wins this round.\"</color>\r\n\r\n<b><color=#33bbee>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</color><color=#009988>Back on the <i>ARGO</i></color><color=#33bbee>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</color></b>\r\n\r\n<color=#bbbbbb>You stare in disbelief at the screen, mouth open.  Darius' shout breaks your trance, \"Noooo!\"\r\n\r\nBarely able to control your emotions, you both watch the events continuing to unfold on the screen.</color>\r\n\r\n<b><color=#33bbee>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</color><color=#009988><i>Hidden game arena on [[TGT_SYSTEM,{TGT_SYSTEM.Name}]]</i></color><color=#33bbee>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</color></b>\r\n\r\nThe door behind [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] opens and two armed and fully masked guards enter pushing a trolly.  They remove the straps and place [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]]'s body onto the trolly and wheel him out of the room.\r\n\r\n<b><color=#33bbee>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</color><color=#009988>Back on the <i>ARGO</i></color><color=#33bbee>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</color></b>\r\n<color=#bbbbbb>\r\nThe screen fades out, and is replaced with a <i>SIGNAL TERMINATED</i> notice.\r\n\r\nA <i>PING</i> alert sounds on the comm panel at your desk.  You move over to it and see an automated text message.  It appears to be from <i>Front Man</i>.\r\n\r\nYou click <i>OPEN</i> to read the message:\r\n\r\n<color=#009988><i>My condolences, Commander {Commander.Lastname}.  Since you are reading this message, it means that [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] did not survive ROUND 1 of the game.\r\n\r\nKnow that {SCN_MW.DET} debt is now paid in full, and there will be no further reparations needed on {SCN_MW.DET} behalf.  In fact, we will be giving you and your crew, a consolation prize.  When [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] left on our dropship, we left behind a crate.  You will find it magnetically attached to your hull outside the docking collar we used to pick up [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]].\r\n\r\nIt is a shame the game did not go the full term, we could have made so much more money and your prize would have been that much greater.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nFront Man</i></color>\r\n\r\nYou look up from the screen and Darius looks at you, \"Commander, it appears that these games were purely chance, with almost no skill involved.  [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]]'s chances of surviving were not that good, I think.\"\r\n\r\nYou lean back in your chair, exhausted from the watching the ordeal that [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] went through, \"Advise the crew, they need to know that [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] is not returning to us.  We need to get past this and get on get on with our jobs.\"\r\n\r\nAs Darius leaves, you cannot help but wonder if your path will cross <i>Front Man</i>'s again.</color>",
