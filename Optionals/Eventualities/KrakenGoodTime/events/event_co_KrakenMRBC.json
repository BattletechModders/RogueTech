    "Details": "You are on the bridge when Sumire calls out, \"Commander, there is a Priority Alpha holocom alert for you.  It's marked CONFIDENTIAL.\"\r\n\r\n\"Send it to my office, Sumire,\" you say as you stand and exit the bridge.\r\n\r\nAs you enter you office, a RED light blinks on the holocom.  You sit down, key in your personal passcode: <color=#FFFF00><i>D4R1U5_15_4N_ID10T</i></color>.  The holocom activates and you see the spinning emblem of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMRBC], Mercenary Review and Bonding Committee]] in front of you, followed by a flashing <color=#FF0000><i>SECURE CONNECTION ESTABLISHED</i></color>.\r\n\r\nThe emblem fades and is replaced by a distinguished looking elderly man, \"Greetings Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}.  I am Jorus Sevar, Legal Counsol for numerous mercenary companies registered with the MRBC.  I am the assigned Counsel for <i><i>{COMPANY.CompanyName}</i></i> and responsible not only in ensuring all contracts are fullfilled properly and legally, but also if there are any issues or informalities arising from complaints about a company for which I am responsible.  As we have not formally met, which is not uncommon, I do need you to confirm you are Commander {COMMANDER.LastName} by submitting a retinal scan please.\"\r\n\r\nA confused look passes across your face, but you opt to comply and see where this leads.  You lean forward and allow the camera to scan your eye.\r\n\r\nYou watch as Sevar checks the information on his terminal, \"Thank you Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}.  Now we can get to meat of what is actually happening.  The MRBC has been contacted by at least 5 citizens, including a one [[DEAD_MW,{DEAD_MW.FirstName}]] <i>[[DEAD_MW,{DEAD_MW.Callsign}]]</i> [[DEAD_MW,{DEAD_MW.LastName}]].  Each is claiming a missing relative was last employed by you and is now missing.  Can you elaborate on that Commander?\"\r\n\r\nYou sit up in your chair, \"Mr Sevar, we are a mercenary company contracted to do various jobs which have a high risk of fatality for those involved.  Any of these missing persons were most likely KIA.\"\r\n\r\nMr Sevar looks at something on his terminal before turning back to you, \"Commander, I am not a jury or judge.  I am here to help you, but to do that, I need to know what happened.  The MRBC has records of you hiring each of the missing persons.  They all show at least one or more pay packets going into their accounts from <i>{COMPANY.CompanyName}</i>.  What they do not show, is any evidence these pilots have been reported as KIA.  As you well know, Section IV, Item C, Paragraph 7 lists all the neccessary procedures when a pilot dies, or is lost in combat.  You have not lodged any of those files.\"\r\n\r\nYou open you desk and grab the crew ledger, skimming through the names of all the pilots that have ever been hired to work for <i>{COMPANY.CompanyName}</i>.  All listed there have documented files as to where, when and how they left the company.  All except the current active crew members and a few who are no longer with the company because of <i>Front Man</i>.  You clear your throat before addressing Mr Sevar, \"Ah, it looks... um, what happens if my records are, um... <i>incomplete</i>?\"\r\n\r\nMr Sevar looks at his terminal and reads out, \"MRBC Guideline 264 states the following:  <i><color=#D4AF37>MechWarriors, and other personel, in the employ of a mercenary company, which have been hired via any MRB Hiring Hall, must have updated records submitted to the MRBC upon any event which changes the status of said MechWarrior or other personel.  Failure to submit valid updates to the MRBC can result in fines of up to ¢3,500,000 and/or reputation penalties lowering your Reputation to below 300.</color></i>\r\nThis means that if you cannot provide evidence that they are still alive, and by this I mean that someone from the MRBC can actually get in touch with them, you could face serious sanctions against your company and your mercenary license.  If you know what has happened to them, then tell me and I'll relay the info and hopefully the MRBC will be more lenient with you for assiting in this enquiry.\"",

There are rules and procedures in place to report mechwarriors, and other crew for that matter, of mercenary companies that die in combat.  This is for any family or benficiaries that they have listed with the MRBC to not only obtain their belongings, but for any insurance policies that they may have had active at the time.  Your failure to report their deaths is, in effect, robbing their relatives of any proceeds due to them.\"\r\n\r\nYou mull over you options before blurting out, \"<i>Front Man</i>.  The missing crew are due to <i>Front Man</i>.\"\r\n\r\nMr Sevar looks at you for a few minutes, \"Who is <i>Front Man</i> and more importantly, how is he involved?\"\r\n\r\nYou spend the next hour going over all the details of the Syndicate, <i>Front Man</i> and the game they had certain members of your crew play.  You do your utmost to persuade Mr Sevar that it was each crew members decision to actually participate in the game in an attempt to clear their debts with the Syndicate.\r\n\r\nMr Sevar, taking notes the whole time, listens intently to your every detail.  When he finishes adding your story into the database he looks back to you, \"I just relayed all you have told me to my superiors.

He reads over the information, \"So, Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}, it would seem that the MRBC is inclined to believe what you have told them.  They have heard similar stories about this Syndicate you mention.\"\r\n\r\nYou give a relieved sigh, \"That is good to hear.  At least we can put this behind us and I can get my company back to work then.\"\r\n\r\nYou reach over to disconnect the holofeed when Mr Sevar interupts you, \"Not so fast, Commander.  Whilst you have indeed been given a pass on the deaths of your former crew members, there is still the matter of failing to adhere to MRB Guidelines.  You did not submit a change of status form to the MRBC for at least 5 of your crew.  That is multiple offenses that carry, if the max penalties were to be applied in this situation, of ¢25,000,000 in fines and your MRB standing reduced to ZERO.\"\r\n\r\nYou fall back in your chair, mouth agape, unable to make a coherent sentence.  Mr Sevar continues, \"But, you have shown willingness to work with the MRBC to rectify this, and as such, the MRBC has decided to show you some leniency here.  As such, the MRBC has decreed that <i>{COMPANY.CompanyName}</i> shall be fined the amount of ¢2,996,066 and your MRBC Rating will be reset to 224.  Please sign this affidavit with your thumb print Commander and I will be on my way.\"\r\n\r\nYour whole body feels numb as you blindly press your thumb to the scanner.  A few seconds later the a beeping tone sounds.  You do not even recall Mr. Sevar signing off, lost in thought as how this all came about."

There are rules and procedures in place to report mechwarriors, and other crew for that matter, of mercenary companies that die in combat.

I cannot answer to the missing personel because I do not know where they are right now.  Yes, they were hired by us and yes, we failed to submit termination papers.  But you have to understand that it wasn't an intentional slight.  We didn't realise it was a contractural requirement.

He reads over the information, \"So, Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}, it would seem that the MRBC is inclined to be lenient with you seeing as this in fact the first time you have run afoul of MRBC policy.\"\r\n\r\nYou give a relieved sigh, \"That is good to hear.  I assure you that we will keep all our paperwork up to date from here on out.  At least we can put this behind us and I can get my company back to work then.\"\r\n\r\nYou reach over to disconnect the holofeed when Mr Sevar interupts you, \"Well, there is still one more issue that has to be resolved, Commander.  Whilst the MRBC has decided to be lenient with you regarding the whereabouts of your former crew members, there is still the matter of failing to adhere to MRB Guidelines.  You did not submit a change of status form to the MRBC for at least 5 of your crew.  That is multiple offenses that carry, if the max penalties were to be applied in this situation, of ¢25,000,000 in fines and your MRB standing reduced to ZERO.\"\r\n\r\nYou fall back in your chair, mouth agape, unable to make a coherent sentence.  Mr Sevar continues, \"But, as you have indicated, and records confirm, your company has never had a breach of contract or policy before, the MRBC has decided to waive all but one of the breaches.  As such, the MRBC has decreed that <i>{COMPANY.CompanyName}</i> shall be fined the amount of ¢1,611,542 and your MRBC Rating will be reset to 263.  Please sign this affidavit with your thumb print Commander and I will be on my way.\"\r\n\r\nYour whole body feels numb as you blindly press your thumb to the scanner.  A few seconds later the a beeping tone sounds.  You do not even recall Mr. Sevar signing off, lost in thought as how this all came about."
