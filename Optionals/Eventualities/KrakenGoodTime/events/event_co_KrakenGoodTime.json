They are attempting to...\"\r\n\r\nSumire is interupted by the holovid activating and displaying an unknown figure before you, \"Greetings, Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}.  My apologies for interupting you at this time, but you currently employ someone who owes me over ¢1,000,000.  I grow weary chasing [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] all over the galaxy, so now I must involve you.\"\r\n\r\nYou look at the screen, \"So I am to just take your word that [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] owes you this money?

Winning the game will result in {SCN_MW.DET} debt being wiped and your company will receive a crate of <i>'goodies'</i>.\"\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] yells out, \"Count me...\" You quickly interupt {SCN_MW.DET}, \"You have not mentioned what happens if they do not win?\"\r\n\r\n<i>Front Man</i> smiles deliciously, \"Well, we would hope that they win, would we not?\"  There is a long silence before he continues, \"Oh very well then, should [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] fail in achieving victory, their debt will be paid in a more permanent manner.\"\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] grabs your arm, spinning you around, \"Commander, I cannot keep running from them, and I cannot afford to pay them off.  I can win whatever 'game' they have planned.  Let me do this!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your decision, Commander?\" says <i>Front Man</i>.",
