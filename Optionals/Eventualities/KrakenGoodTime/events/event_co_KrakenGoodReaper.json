My records show you have made a few million C-Bills off sending pilots to compete in the games.  Your proclivity to hire criminals has been noticed, and not only by the Syndicate.\"\r\n\r\nYou stare icily at <i>Front Man</i>, \"You have the gall to accuse me of impropriety when you are running a 'game' geared at getting the participants killed.  You are a hypocrit.\"\r\n\r\n<i>Front Man</i> smiles evilly at you, \"Ah, see that is where you make a critical mistake.  I do not have to play by the same rules as you do.  You are a mercenary company, and ultimately answer to the MRBC.  Which means you can either risk losing precious reputation with them or reimburse the Syndicate a portion of the funds you've accrued feeding certain crew into the 'game'.
