Ok folks, let's hope [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] makes it through this.\"\r\n\r\nDarius punches in some information on the terminal next to the large display screen mounted on the wall in your office, \"Transmission coming in now, Commander.\"\r\n\r\nThe black screen shimmers to life, the blurry images slowly taking focus.  The image resolves into a view of [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] being escorted down a hallway along with a number of other <i>players</i>, each with a number displayed on their shirts.\r\n\r\nYou all stare intently at the screen, eyes riveted hoping that [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] wins this round and continues on to the finale.</color>\r\n\r\n<b><color=#33bbee>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</color><color=#009988><i>Hidden game arena on [[TGT_SYSTEM,{TGT_SYSTEM.Name}]]</i></color><color=#33bbee>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</color></b>\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] walks down the hallway with {SCN_MW.DET} fellow <i>contestants</i>.  There are guards with them, their faces covered with full masks reminding {SCN_MW.OBJ} of DEST Commando soldiers.\r\n\r\nOne by one, the procession stops and a player is ushered into a room with a guard.  Eventually, it is [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]]'s turn to enter a room.  {SCN_MW.SUBJ_C} looks around, seeing four blank walls and a mirror.  Thankfully there is not the chair or the laser pistol so {SCN_MW.SUBJ} knows this will be a different kind of game.\r\n\r\nThe guard pulls a circular ring shaped device out of a satchel they are carrying.  The ring is hinged on one side with four coloured wires coming out of it and connected to a box.  The guard opens ring and moves over to [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] and secures it around {SCN_MW.DET} neck.  The guard then clips the box to [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]]'s belt, with the four wires running up across {SCN_MW.DET} chest to the collar.\r\n\r\nThe guard then exits the room and a voice is heard over the loud speaker:  <color=#D4AF37>\"Welcome players to the next game.  The name of today's game is <i>BOMB-DIGGITY</i>.  The objective is to disarm the bomb in the wired collar around your neck.  To do this, you must cut one of the wires leading from the trigger to the collar.  Cut the correct wire, and it will disable the device.  You have 60 seconds to cut the wire.  The clock begins... NOW!\"</color>\r\n\r\nA hatch opens in the ceiling and a pair of wire snips falls to the floor.  [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] quickly grabs up the snips, and moves over to the mirror, inspecting each wire to garner some inclination as to which one should be cut.\r\n\r\n<color=#D4AF37>\"TIME LEFT 30 SECONDS\"</color>\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] stares into the mirror before closing {SCN_MW.DET} eyes.  {SCN_MW.SUBJ_C} opens them, then raises the snips up to...\r\n\r\n<b><color=#33bbee>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</color><color=#009988>Back on the <i>ARGO</i></color><color=#33bbee>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</color></b>\r\n\r\n<color=#bbbbbb>\r\nDarius yells out to the screen,  \"Cut the RED wire!\"\r\n\r\nYang looks at Darius, \"Are you daft? The BLACK wire is the one to cut.\"\r\n\r\nSumire smiles, \"Clearly the WHITE wire is the one that should be cut.\"\r\n\r\nDr Murad ponders the options before responding, \"I would cut the BLUE wire.\"</color>\r\n\r\n<b><color=#33bbee>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</color><color=#009988><i>Hidden game arena on [[TGT_SYSTEM,{TGT_SYSTEM.Name}]]</i></color><color=#33bbee>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</color></b>\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] moves the wire snips into position and decides to...",

This appears to be nothing more than a series of random tests, a 'leave it to the roll of the dice' decision.\"\r\n\r\nYou drop into your chair, exhausted from the elation that [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] has survived to reach the final game, but fearful that {SCN_MW.DET} situation can change in the blink of an eye.

Who would concoct such a game?\"\r\n\r\nDr Murad speaks up, barely able to talk without choking up, \"Actually Yang, these types of <i>games</i> are spread throughout history.  On Terra, there was a game called <i>Russian Roulette</i> which involved a rotary firearm and a single round, and each participant pointing the weapon at the other one until it eventually fired on a loaded chamber.
