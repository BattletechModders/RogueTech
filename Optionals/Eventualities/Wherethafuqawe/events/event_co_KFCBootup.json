The console has power and is ready to be turned on.\"\r\n\r\nYou motion to the power switch, \"It's your project.  The honours are yours.\"\r\n\r\nSumire reaches out and pushes the button on the console.  An audible click sounds, along with a number of whirring fans.  The console's screen flickers before focusing and revealing the display where a large blinking <color=#FF0000>ACTIVATE?</color> pulses.\r\n\r\nSumire looks at you, \"It appears to be working so far, Commander.  You should be the one to activate it.\"",
