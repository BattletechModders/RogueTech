Are you trying to shake me down, MechWarrior?\"\r\n\r\n[[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] is shocked, \"Gosh no, Commander!  I may have had a coloured past, but I left that life behind me.  If I were trying to extort this company, I would not be here telling you this, it would have been delivered via a RANSOMWARE packet or similar means.  I assure you, this, as much as it seems suspect, is legit.\"\r\n\r\nYou relax a bit, \"I suspect there is a BUT in that explanation somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n[[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] nods, \"Unfortunately yes, Commander.  Try as I might, my former so-called friends still want to be paid for anything they do to change or remove that file.\"\r\n\r\nYou snort, \"I guess I can't really expect a group of hackers to do anything for free eh? \"\r\n\r\nYou push a button on your desk console, \"Darius, get in here.\"  \r\n\r\nA few moments later Darius enters your office, \"Yes, Commander?\" \r\n\r\nYou motion for Darius to sit down before turning back to [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]], \"So, how much do they want, and what precisely can they do for us?\"\r\n\r\n[[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] responds, \"There are a couple of things they can do, with the varying cost based on how many auditors have been assigned your case:  \r\n\r\nReset the marker on jump costs back to ¢25,000 per jump.  You may still get a followup flag from the CJSTA, but you'll not be spending a ton of extra C-Bills on travel.  Expect a fee of up to ¢5,000,000.\r\n \r\nThe other option is a complete wipe of your file and audit trail.  This is the most extensive cover-up and as such can cost close to ¢7,500,000.  You'll only be contacted by the CJSTA again if you keep traveling the way you have been that got you flagged in the first place.\r\n\r\nI'll relay your choice to my former associates.\"",
