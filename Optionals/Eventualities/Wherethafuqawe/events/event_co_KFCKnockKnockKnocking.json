    "Details": "You awaken to an unusual knocking sound.  It is quite at odds to the even pulsing rhythm coming from the jumpship's Kearny-Fuchida drive that the <i>Argo</i> is docked to as it charges in preparation for the next jump.  You look at your chronograph, the digits showing it is after midnight in the standard sleep cycle.\r\n\r\nYou reach over to your nightstand and key in the intercom code for <i>Engineering</i>.\r\n\r\n<color=#00B7EB>Click... Click...</color> A voice answers, \"Engineering.\"\r\n\r\nYou clear your throat, \"This is Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}, What's going on down there?  What the hell is that knocking noise?\"\r\n\r\nThe ensign nervously answers, \"Uh, Commander, Sir, uh, we don't know yet what is causing it.  Dr Murad has gone to <i>Navigation</i> to investigate it further.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, ensign,\" you respond as you disconnect the call.\r\n\r\nYou punch in the code for <i>Naviagtion</i>.\r\n\r\n<color=#00B7EB>Click... Click...</color> A voice answers, \"Navigation.\"\r\n\r\nYou do not even identify yourself, \"Put Dr Murad on the line.\"\r\n\r\nSeconds later Dr Murad answers, \"I presume the knocking noise woke you, Commander?\"\r\n\r\nYou let out a short laugh, \"What in blazes is going on up there?  Do I need to come to the bridge?\"\r\n\r\nDr Murad calmly responds, \"I don't thinks so Commander.  I've narrowed it  down to something in Navigation, but am not 100% sure of the cause yet.\"",
