It is quite at odds to the even pulsing rhythm coming from the jumpship's Kearny-Fuchida drive that the <i>Argo</i> is docked to as it charges in preparation for the next jump.  You look at your chronograph, the digits showing it is after midnight in the standard sleep cycle.\r\n\r\nYou reach over to your nightstand and key in the intercom code for <i>Engineering</i>.\r\n\r\n<color=#00B7EB>Click... Click...</color> A voice answers, \"Engineering.\"\r\n\r\nYou clear your throat, \"This is Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}, What's going on down there?  What the hell is that knocking noise?\"\r\n\r\nThe ensign nervously answers, \"Uh, Commander, Sir, uh, we don't know yet what is causing it.  Dr Murad has gone to <i>Navigation</i> to investigate it further.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, ensign,\" you respond as you disconnect the call.\r\n\r\nYou punch in the code for <i>Naviagtion</i>.\r\n\r\n<color=#00B7EB>Click... Click...</color> A voice answers, \"Navigation.\"\r\n\r\nYou do not even identify yourself, \"Put Dr Murad on the line.\"\r\n\r\nSeconds later Dr Murad answers, \"I presume the knocking noise woke you, Commander?\"\r\n\r\nYou let out a short laugh, \"What in blazes is going on up there?  Do I need to come to the bridge?\"\r\n\r\nDr Murad calmly responds, \"I don't thinks so Commander.  I've narrowed it  down to something in Navigation, but am not 100% sure of the cause yet.\"",

If I don't find the cause, we won't be getting much sleep Commander.\"\r\n\r\nA louder bang resonates from over by the Kerby-FuCheetah Console.  Dr Murad goes to investigate, \"Oh, that's interesting!\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you find out the cause?\" you ask.\r\n\r\nDr Murad sounds surprised, \"Possibly Commander.  I suspect it is coming from our newly installed Console.  I've had a quick inspection of the Console, and it appears we may have a failing <i>Cheatah NavCom</i>.  I've jiggled it and the noise has stopped for now.\"\r\n\r\nYou yawn loudly, \"I'm going back to sleep.  Keep an eye on things and let me know if things go south.\"",
