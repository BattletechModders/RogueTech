What is in it for you?\"\r\n\r\nThe figure laughs, \"C-Bills of course, what else?  Look, I have a single use access code which will allow you to log into the CJSTA server and delete any flags assocatied with you or {COMPANY.CompanyName}. For a measly sum of ¢2,500,000.\"\r\n\r\nYou whistle, \"That's a bit steep is it not?\"\r\n\r\nThe figure smiles, \"Enjoy paying those fines they will continue to issue to you.  Who knows, perhaps you will be lucky enough to find a hacker willing to help you one day.  I can assure you, they will cost more to do the same job.\"\r\n\r\nYou contemplate the offer...",
