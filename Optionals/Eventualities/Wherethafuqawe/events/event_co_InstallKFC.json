    "Details": "You hear a knock on the door to your office, \"Enter,\" you call out as you press the <i>OPEN</i> button on your desk. The door slides back to reveal Dr Murad and Sumire.\r\n\r\nThey both stride in and begin talking at once, \"Commander, we have...\"\r\n\r\nYou hold up your hand, \"One at a time, please!\"\r\n\r\nThey look at each other before Sumire turns to you, \"Commander, we have just acquired all the components to put together a KF Console.\"\r\n\r\nYou raise your eyebrows, \"What, pray tell, is a KF Console?\"\r\n\r\nSumire smiles, \"Well, it is... umm, well... it is pirate tech and from what other navigators have told me, it is a way to <i>potentially</i> use [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LorePiratePoint],Pirate Points]] to get to systems quicker.\"\r\n\r\nYour brow wrinkles, \"Do I really have to remind you that the <i>Argo</i> is not jump capable, it is a giant dropship?\"\r\n\r\nDr Murad smiles, \"Yes, the <i>Argo</i> is a dropship, but it is massive, and has very powerful engines.  Although the KF Console is supposed to be installed on a jumpship,  I have a way to install it on the <i>Argo</i>.\"\r\n\r\nYou still look confused, \"Without a Kearny-Fuchida drive, we still need to use jumpships for travel.  So I fail to see how this console thingy will benefit us at all.\"\r\n\r\nDr Murad taps her datapad and sends images and schematics onto the screen on the wall in your office, \"The basic premise is this, Commander.  With an activated KF Console onboard the <i>Argo</i>, we can send data to whichever jumpship we have docked with and substitute their NavCom data with that generated by the Console.  This will mean the jumpship will then arrive at a pirate point of the system we are going to.\"\r\n\r\nYou steeple your fingers in front of you, \"You think you can just convice a Jumpship Captain to risk using a [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LorePiratePoint],pirate point]]?'\r\n\r\nDr Murad speaks up, \"Actually, the navigator will never even know their coordinates have been replaced.  They will most likely assume there was a system malfunction or something.  The chances of us being singled out as the cause are slim.\"\r\n\r\nYou shake your head, \"Still sounds a lot like using a virus to deliver data to a computer that does not belong to us.  What if we do [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMisjump],misjump]]?  What then?\"\r\n\r\nDr Murad clears her throat, \"Well, there is always a risk of a [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMisjump],misjump]] regardless of whether a [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LorePiratePoint],pirate point]] is used or not.  Aside from the absolute worst case scenario, total structural implosion, my research suggests that if we were to misjump from the use of the Console, it would either fling us to an uncharted system, we could sustain damage to the <i>Argo's</i> engines, or a combination of both.\"\r\n\r\nSumire looks at you, \"How do you wish to proceed, Commander?\"",
