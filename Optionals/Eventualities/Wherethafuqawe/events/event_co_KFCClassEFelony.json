    "Details": "Darius knocks on the open doorway to you office before entering, carrying a datapad, “Commander, we’ve received a communique from the Commercial Jumpship Travel Authority.”\r\nYou take the datapad and read the message on the screen:\r\n<color=#00B7EB>\r\n<i>COMMERICAL JUMPSHIP TRAVEL AUTHORITY, Compliance Divison\r\n\r\nAttention Commander {COMMANDER.FirstName} {COMMANDER.LastName}, of the mercenary company  {COMPANY.CompanyName}:\r\n\r\nWe have received over half a dozen complaints regarding and/or relating to the substitution of data stored onboard the NavComs of various jumpships tasked with transporting {COMPANY.CompanyName} and it’s dropship, the ARGO. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, empirical proof has been provided to the CJSTA that one or more members of {COMPANY.CompanyName} and/or computers onboard the ARGO have maliciously and intentionally accessed NavCom systems onboard a Jumpship hired to transport the ARGO and its crew. \r\n\r\nAccessing a Jumpship’s internal computer systems without authorisation is deemed a Class E Felony which provides the CJSTA the authority to impose sanctions, fines and ultimately blacklisting of those guilty from using the CJSTA network. \r\n\r\nThe Association has investigated the data presented and rules in favour of the Jumpship Captains.  As such, {COMPANY.CompanyName} is being issued a Non-Compliance of By-Laws ruling and…</i></color>\r\n\r\nYou stop reading there, noting the additional 36 pages in the message, and toss the datapad on the desk, “Just sum it up for me Darius.”\r\n\r\nDarius picks up the pad, “Well, basically we have been reported for using the Console to trick those jumpships into arriving at Pirate Points. The main issue is more related to the misjumps we have had then the actual use of Pirate Points, so now the CJSTA wants compensation.”\r\n\r\nYou cup your chin with your thumb and forefinger, “So, what's the bottom line?”\r\n\r\nDarius scrolls through a few pages, “We have two options here:\r\n\r\n\r\n We can opt to pay the fine as a lump sum now or agree to a slight increase to our Jumpship costs.”\r\n\r\nDarius looks up from the datapad and awaits your decision.",
