It seems the <i>fix</i> we had done on our jump records has been noticed and come under scrutiny by the CJSTA.\"\r\n\r\nYou groan, \"Damn!  I was hoping we would have more time.  What are they wanting now?\"\r\n\r\nDarius responds, \"We haven't heard from the CJSTA.  Our new <i>associates</i> have sent a message via the datakey to let us know we are back on the CJSTA's radar apparently.\"\r\n\r\nYou pause, thinking, \"So, we can either wait for them to notify us of being in breach again, or we can have our new <i>associates</i> take care of things.\"\r\n\r\nDarius nods again, \"We already tried just wiping the jump cost records.  Perhaps we should look at a full record clean?  Ultimately, it is your call Commander.\"",
