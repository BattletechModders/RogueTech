Getting parts for the Console here and now would be so much easier than hoping for the right contract to be posted on the notice boards.'</color></i>  \"You trying to scam me or what?\"\r\n\r\nThe cloaked figure moves out of the shadows, \"No, heavens no, my friend.  I just have access to the key components for a Console, and am willing to give you first opportunity to purchase them.\"\r\n\r\nYou cross your arms in front of your chest, \"What's the catch?  Are these broken parts, used or stolen or whatever?\"\r\n\r\nThe figure laughs, \"I guess I would be suspicious if our roles were reversed.  You can have a look at the parts and judge for yourself.\"\r\n\r\nYou turn to Yang, \"What do you think?\"\r\n\r\nYang shrugs, \"Farah's the expert on stuff like this, but I can definitely run my eye over them and tell if they are second hand or not.\"\r\n\r\n",
