    "Details": "Sitting in your command chair, you can feel the even rhythm coming from the jumpships Kearny-Fuchida drive that the <i>Argo</i> is docked to as it  charges in preparation for jump.\r\n\r\nThat rhythm soon takes on an erractic pulse, with vibrations and shudders groaning throughout the <i>Argo,</i>  You look over to Darius, \"STATUS REPORT!\"\r\n\r\nDarius, busy at the terminal calls out, \"Commander, it appears something is malfunctioning on the jumpship.  Their Captain reports engineering is working on it, but they do not know the reason or source at this time!\"\r\n\r\nSumire gets your attention, \"Commander, it appears the Kerby-Fucheatah Console is sending data to the jumpship.\"\r\n\r\nYou look over to her, \"What?  I thought it only sent data the one time to the jumpship.  You mean to tell me it is doing something more than that?\"\r\n\r\nSumire punches buttons on the console, \"I believe so, Commander.\"\r\n\r\nYou jump out of your command chair and rush over to the console.  The data displayed makes no real sense to you.  You look at Sumire, \"Well, you're the navigator, how do we stop this?\"\r\n\r\nSumire's hands run over the keyboard, pressing various buttons before she looks at you, \"I do not think we can stop this, Commander.  When I try to deactivate the console, it displays a timer for shutdown, but the next jump will have occured by the time it actually shuts off.  What should we do Commander?\"",
