    "Details": "<color=#0033FF>Unlocked through Event by collecting lootbox components from Pirate Sponsored Contracts.</color>\n\nSo those crazy pirates have built a console to calculate <i>Pirate Points</i>.  It gets power from the Pirate Drive Harness and then overrides a jumpships NavCom to allow the console operator to substitute new coordinates closer to the target planet.  KF Consoles have 3 main parts: [[DM.UpgradeDefs[Gear_KerbyInjectors],Kerby Injectors]], [[DM.UpgradeDefs[Gear_FuCapacitor],Fu Capacitor]]s and a [[DM.UpgradeDefs[Gear_CheatahNavComputer],Cheatah Nav Computer]].  Blueprints are also needed for assembly.  Doing specific Ambush, Rescue and Escort missions for Pirates will be rewarded with one of these parts.",
