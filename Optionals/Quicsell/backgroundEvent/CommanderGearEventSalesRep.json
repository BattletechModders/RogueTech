The pile of discarded tools and kicked-over crates of equipment at least tell you he went through anger before you got here. That's good.\n\nAs you approach, he throws up his hands. \"Look, I know we have to work for these guys, but <i>come on</i>!\" He starts, incredulous. Perhaps he wasn't quite done with anger yet.\n\n\"Hey. Just relax, Yang,\" you say, attempting to reassure him, \"it could be worse. They could've just given us a gift card for fifty-percent off [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreTripleFBurger],Triple-F]] burgers or something.\"\n\nWrong move. Yang throws down his plasma torch. \"Yeah? I think I would've preferred that, Boss. Enjoy your corporate mandated coffin.\"\n\nAs Yang storms off in a huff, you turn your eyes to the 'Mech in the bay.",
