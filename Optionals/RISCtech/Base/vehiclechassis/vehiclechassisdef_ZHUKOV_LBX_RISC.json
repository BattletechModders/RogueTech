    "Details": "In 3048 RISC Engineers produced one of the more sensible designs ever to emerge from a think tank full of eccentrics geniuses. A Fuel Cell engine and Heavy Ferrofibrous armor allowed significant upgrades to the survivability and firepower of the reliable Zhukov. In 3030, Aldis Industries deployed the successful follow up to its venerable Demolisher design, the slightly lighter Zhukov. While it shares many of the parts and features of the design that inspired it, the Zhukov is smaller, better armored, and packs less weaponry than its predecessor. Its first major deployment was with the Wolf's Dragoons whereupon the Zhukov has since seen constant improvements and tweaks as suggested to Aldis Industries by the field units that use it. The Zhukov's strength is its relative simplicity. Two turret mounted SarLon MaxiCannon Autocannon/10s are more than adequate at providing sufficient firepower for the discriminating buyer while imitating its larger cousin the Demolisher.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Fuel Cell: Improved vehicle engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 3/5 Hex: 90/150 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Heavy Ferro\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       305     40\n<b>Left</b>         220     40\n<b>Right</b>       220     40\n<b>Rear</b>        175     40\n<b>Turret</b>      235     40\n\n<b>Total</b>      1155    200\n</color>",
