Ok folks, let's hope [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] makes it through the final challenge.\"\r\n\r\nDarius punches in some information on the terminal next to the large display screen mounted on the wall in your office, \"Transmission coming in now, Commander.\"\r\n\r\nThe black screen shimmers to life, the blurry images slowly taking focus.  The image resolves into a view of [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] in a courtyard along with a number of other players.  Each player has a number displayed on their shirts.\r\n\r\nEveryone is watching the screen, when Yang yells out, \"C'mon [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]], you got this!</color>\r\n\r\n<b><color=#33bbee>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</color><color=#009988><i>Hidden game arena on [[TGT_SYSTEM,{TGT_SYSTEM.Name}]]</i></color><color=#33bbee>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</color></b>\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] stands in a courtyard with {SCN_MW.DET} fellow contestants.  There are guards everywhere, their faces still covered with full masks so that no one can see their faces.\r\n\r\nA bell chimes and a voice is heard over the comms channel, <color=#D4AF37>\"Welcome players to the next game.  For this game, you will pair off into groups of two.

It was used to settle disputes by children and in some countries, was also used by adults.\"\r\n\r\nSumire enquires, \"Do you know the rules?\"\r\n\r\nDr Murad nods, \"Yes, I have played this as a child, more as a fun competition than to settle any disagreements.  Where I grew up, we called it 'Rock, Paper, Scissors.  The principle is quite simple, you would face your opponent, and both count to three while shaking your closed hand in front of each other.  On the final 3, you would quickly resolve your hand into one of they poses:  A closed fist, ROCK; an open palm, PAPER or your two fingers extended in a V with the rest tucked in: SCISSORS.  The winner is determined by the strongest hand.\"\r\n\r\nYang interupts, \"Well that is a stupid game, rock wins every time!\"\r\n\r\nDr Murad shakes her head, \"No, Yang, it does not.  The strength of each is as follows:  ROCK breaks SCISSORS, SCISSORS cuts PAPER and PAPER covers ROCK.\"\r\n\r\nYou mull this over, \"So [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] needs to pick someone whom {SCN_MW.SUBJ} can either outsmart or intimidate into picking a weaker hand?\"\r\n\r\nDarius looks on skeptically, \"I don't know Commander, I think this is just another random game of pure chance.\"</color>\r\n\r\n<b><color=#33bbee>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</color><color=#009988><i>Hidden game arena on [[TGT_SYSTEM,{TGT_SYSTEM.Name}]]</i></color><color=#33bbee>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</color></b>\r\n\r\nThe voice continues, <color=#D4AF37>\"You and your opponent will extend one closed hand in front of each other.  Count to three and form your and into the shape of a ROCK by keeping your fist closed.  Form the shape of PAPER by extending your hand out flat.  Form SCISSORS by extending your two fingers out in a V and tucking the others into your palm.  Rock beats Scissors, which beats Paper, which beats Rock.  The winners will face off against each other until only one winner is left.  That person will win be crowned 'Champion'.  Refusing to play will result in the player opting to forfeit.  The game begins... NOW!\"</color>\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] stares into the eyes of <color=#D4AF37><i>PLAYER 5</i></color>.  They put their hands out before them and count:\r\n\r\nONE...
