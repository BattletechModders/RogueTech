    "Details": "Templeton Banacek missed graduating from his sibko as full-fledged MechWarrior due to an lucky strike crippling the life support of his 'Mech and forcing him to abandon the Trial.  Relegated to the motorpool, Templeton used his wile and charisma to work his way up the ranks and becoming a Star Captain, commanding both 'Mech and Vehicle stars.  His ability to procure almost anything even when on remote battlefields allowed his Cluster to win most of their battles, even when sorely outnumbered and supplies were running low.",
