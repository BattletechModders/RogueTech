    "Details": "Born of the Banacek and Talasko bloodlines, Hannibal was the only member of his sibko to graduate as a warrior. Despite his pro-Warden leanings and outspoken criticism of the Crusader ideology - which made him a target for many Trials early in his career - Hannibal's tactical skills ensured his challengers' failure even as he rose through the ranks. In 3057 he won the Banacek Bloodname and by 3059 was commanding the Fifth Assault Cluster in his Clan's Alpha Galaxy. In this prestigious post, Banacek was repeatedly commended by his superiors for his resourcefulness and battlefield flair. During the Burrock Absorption it was under his command that the outnumbered 5th spearheaded the charge at Fort Weller which broke Clan Blood Spirit's defenses and forced them to withdraw from Albion.\n\n",
