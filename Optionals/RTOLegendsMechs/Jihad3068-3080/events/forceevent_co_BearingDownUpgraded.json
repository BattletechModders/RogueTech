You spy him over at a corner table seated with the biggest man you've ever seen.  You move to join them, \"That was unbelievable my friend!  You practically owned that arena!\"\r\n\r\nThe grin on Bearing's face tells you he is feeling quite chuffed himself even before he speaks, \"Thank you, Commander {COMMANDER.FirstName} {COMMANDER.LastName}.  I am really proud of how the Baracas Battle Armour performs.\"  Bearing motions to the man towering over even his immense frame, \"This is Boscoe Banacek.  He is the driver of the GMC Vandura transport.\"\r\n\r\nYou extend you hand to Boscoe, \"You are quite the pilot there.  You two are a veritable wrecking crew!\"  You start to fire off a number of questions when Boscoe Banacek interrupts, \"Hey Man, too much jibba jabba!\"\r\n\r\nBearing hardly contains his laughter, \"You must excuse my clansman.  He is a man of very few words.\"\r\n\r\nYou smile, \"Understood.  So tell me, is your business with Star Adder now concluded?\"\r\n\r\n \"Aff, Commander {COMMANDER.FirstName} {COMMANDER.LastName}.  If you have the room, and you are willing, I would like to rejoin {COMPANY.CompanyName}.  Before you make your decision, also know that in addition to myself and the Baracas Battle Armour, Boscoe Banacek and his GMC Vandura would also like to accompany me.\"",
