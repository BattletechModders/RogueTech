    "Details": "As you enter the dingy bar on <i>{TGT_SYSTEM.Name}</i>, you wonder what state you will find Bearing in after his failure to successfully obtain his bloodname in the Trial.  You spy him over at a corner table seated alone and staring into his drink.  You move to join him, \"That was an amazing battle, my friend.  Too bad the odds were stacked against you.\"\r\n\r\nThe look on Bearing's face tells you he is less than thrilled with the outcome even before he speaks, \"Neg, Commander {COMMANDER.FirstName} {COMMANDER.LastName}.  I should have easily defeated all of my opponents.  Errors were made and now I will have to live with those results.  I am confident the Baracas Battle Armour can perform decisively in battle.\" \r\n\r\nYou clasp your hands in front of you as you lean on the table, \"It is not the end of the world, my friend.  Look how far you have already come.  I am sure the Star Adders have not seen the last of you.\"\r\n\r\nBearing lifts his glass and downs the last swallow, \"Aff, Commander {COMMANDER.FirstName} {COMMANDER.LastName}, and pursuant to that, I would like to formally request rejoining {COMPANY.CompanyName}.  I trust you could use a good mechwarrior and their battle armour, quiaff?\"",
