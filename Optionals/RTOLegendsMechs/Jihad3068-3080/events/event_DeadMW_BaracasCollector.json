His eyes lock onto you and he promptly heads your way.  When he gets to your table, you look up smiling, \"Looking for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes Boss,\" Yang responds.  \r\n\r\nYou motion for him to sit, \"Care for a glass?\"\r\n\r\nYang smiles as he sits down, \"You bet your ass I do!\"\r\n\r\nYou signal the waitstaff to bring over a glass for Yang and then turn back to him, \"So, you looked pretty focused on finding me, what's up? Something wrong in the MechBay?\"\r\n\r\nYang shakes his head, \"Gods no, Boss.  Running as smooth as fresh coolant.  But, I have had some more responses to our enquiry about selling [[DEAD_MW,{DEAD_MW.Callsign}]]'s suit of <i>Rogue Bear Battle Armour</i>.\"\r\n\r\nYou sit up straighter, more interested in the conversation now, \"Do tell.\"\r\n\r\nYang proceeds to relate the various offers and questions that have come in over the HPG network.  Eventually he comes to main reason for seeking you out, \"So Boss, there is a collector here in [[TGT_SYSTEM,{TGT_SYSTEM.Name}]] that is very interested in <i>Baracas</i> and they are willing to pay a decent chunk of change for it.\"\r\n\r\nYou take swig of your drink, \"How much are they offering?\"\r\n\r\nYang shrugs and slides over a datapad, \"They wouldn't say but they hinted at \u00A21,500,000 which is way above any of the other offers we got.  I have their details on this datapad and they have asked that you contact them personally to discuss.  They also said this is a one time offer, so you need to act on it now.\"",
