  "Description": "Bergan Industries was an advanced manufacturing facility, producing such equipment as the Royal variant of the venerable Locust BattleMech for the Star League Defense Force.  Bergan Industries has manufacturing centers on Alshain, Ares, New Earth and New Oslo.  After the Ghost Bears absorbed the Free Rasalhague Republic, Bergan Industries opened new plants on Thule and Rasalhague.  Bergan Industries became a huge part of the Ghost Bear's industrial base. They invested heavily in the company, and this investment allowed Bergan to expand into some other realms.",
