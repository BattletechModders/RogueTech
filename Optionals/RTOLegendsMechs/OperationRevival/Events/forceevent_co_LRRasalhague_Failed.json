    "Details": "You storm into the briefing room to hear the excuses you know will be babbling out of everyones mouths about why this mission failed.  Holding up your hand towards everyone, you look around with a steel-eyed gaze.  No one speaks, their mouths partially open but the words not forthcoming, before you eventually address those present, \"That, was a horrible display that makes us look as incompetant as a Capellan trying to stab someone in chest.  I don't even know where to begin with what snowballed into a disastrous result for {COMPANY.CompanyName}!\"\r\n\r\nYou are about to continue when Darius clears his throat and tentatively stands, interrupting your tirade, \"Uh, Commander, before you continue with the well deserved dressing down we all need, I just want to point out that we are being offered another chance to get the job done.\"\r\n\r\nYou choke back your pending outburst, \"What do you mean, <i>another chance</i>?  We failed the mission.  How can we <i>try again</i>?  This isn't a video game you know!\"\r\n\r\nDarius nods, \"Aye, Commander, <i>Bergan Industries</i> advises that the attackers are currently regrouping so the remaining personnel at the supply depot have rallied and restored some of the defenses.  We are the only available resource in [[TGT_SYSTEM,{TGT_SYSTEM.Name}]] until they can get more units in the area.\"",
