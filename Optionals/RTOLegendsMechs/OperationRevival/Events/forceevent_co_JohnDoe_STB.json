        "Details" : "You're relaxing in your office when the comm panel chimes, \"Yes?\" \r\n\r\n\"Commander,  Dr Richard instructed me to let you know that the mystery patient is awake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, let Dr Richard know I'm on my way.\"  You stand up and head out the door to the MedBays.\r\n\r\nYou arrive to see Dr Richard and a number of MedTechs busy around the patient.  You move forward to finally get a look at who you rescued with their bandages off, \"Greetings...\"\r\n\r\nThe patient smiles, \"You may call me Burt O'Nias.  I owe you a great deal apparently, for getting me here to heal and recover.  Dr Richard says I would have died if you had not rescued me.\"\r\n\r\nYou smile, \"Anyone else would have done the same given the situation.  Do you know what happened? Or any other details?  Where you are from?  How did...\"\r\n\r\nDr Richard puts a hand on your shoulder, \"Commander, if you please, Mr Burt O'Nias needs his rest and he has not fully recovered all of his memories.  May we speak in private?\"\r\n\r\nYou nod, \"Of course Dr.\"  You turn back to the patient, \"Burt, continue to get better and we'll work out the details later, ok?\"\r\n\r\nBurt O'Nias looks at you with a deadpan face but says nothing as you turn and move into the corridor with Dr Richard.  You grin widely as you say, \"Ehh, what's up Doc?\"\r\n\r\nDr Richard, obviously not a humorous person, grimaces, then continues, \"Well Commander, as I said in there, Mr Burt O'Nias is ready for active duty now, which is amazing.  He has passed simulator tests as a MechWarrior, but failed the vehicular tests, which does not surprise me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why would failing the vehicle test not surprise you, Doc and why do you keep using his name like he's someone important,\" you state.\r\n\r\n\"Commander?!  You are telling me you do not know who that man is in there?\" Dr Richard asks incredulously.\r\n\r\nYour face shows its confusion clearly, \"Am I supposed to know everyone that we find on the battlefield?\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor smiles, \"Your mystery patient is none other than the former saKhan of the Ghost Bears, Burt O'Nias.  So yes, out of respect due to someone of his infamy, I'll.. I <i>will</i> honour his beliefs and address him as he would be addressed amoungst his clansmen.  Well, without his title.  He said he is not the saKhan at this point in time, so we can just call him <i>Burt O'Nias</i>.  \r\nAs for the vehicle tests, he is a <i>trueborn</i> of the Ghost Bears, so only those who failed their </i>Trial of Position</i> for rank and a mech would ever consider operating a vehicle.\"\r\n\r\nA big smile creeps across your face as you look back at the man lying there in the medical bed, \"Doc, thank you for the history lesson.  If we can convince him to stay with us, we could very well have a valuable asset to this Company.\"\r\n\r\nYou head back over to the bed, \"If I had known we had someone of your stature here I would have assigned you to my personal medical suite, Burt O'Nias.  I would however, like to take this moment to offer you employent here with {COMPANY.CompanyName}.\"\r\n\r\nBurt O'Nias looks at you with the eyes of a MechWarrior that has seen and heard just about everything imaginable before smiling at you, \"Many Thanks, Commander {COMMANDER.FirstName} {COMMANDER.LastName}.  I appreciate your generousity but I do not wish to be pampered.  I lost my mech in the battle that wounded me and your rescue has put me in your debt.  I do not wish to seem ungrateful, but if you do not have a heavy mech for me, then I would have to deny your offer.  You have a heavy mech that is worthy for the field of battle, quiaff?\"",
