Holding up your hand towards everyone, you look around with a steel-eyed gaze.  No one speaks, their mouths partially open but the words not forthcoming, before you eventually address those present, \"That, was a horrible display that makes us look as incompetant as a Capellan trying to stab someone in the chest.  I don't even know where to begin with what snowballed into a disastrous result for {COMPANY.CompanyName}!\"\r\n\r\nYou are about to continue when Darius clears his throat and tentatively stands, interrupting your tirade, \"Uh, Commander, before you continue with the well deserved dressing down we all need, I just want to point out that we are being offered another chance to get the job done.\"\r\n\r\nYou choke back your pending outburst, \"What do you mean, <i>another chance</i>?  We failed the mission.  How can we <i>try again</i>?  This isn't a video game you know!\"\r\n\r\nDarius nods, \"Aye, Commander. Apparently they were afraid things may go badly, so we ended up attempting to protect a decoy convoy.  They are trying again, and need us to come back and complete the contract successfully this time.\"",
