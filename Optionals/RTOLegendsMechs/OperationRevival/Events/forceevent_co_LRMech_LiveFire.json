    "Details": "The trip down to [[TGT_SYSTEM,{TGT_SYSTEM.Name}]] was as uneventful as last time.  Sumire heads directly to the private landing pad at the <i>Bergan Industires</i> facility.\r\n\r\nThis time, however, you are greeted by a stock standard <i>Bergan Industires</i> Liaison,  You don't even catch their name as you board the waiting <i>[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[Lore_BerganAPC],APC]]</i>.  At least it is the same luxury vehicle as last time, so you pour yourself a drink and sit back enjoying the ride in comfort.\r\n\r\nYou arrive at the facility and are escorted past numerous guards.  You can already see an amazing amount of repair work has been completed.  You soon arrive at your destination, the same glass walled room that overlooks one of the facility's production floors.\r\n\r\nYou see Alys and [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] standing beside their chairs at the table.  Alys smiles at you, \"Welcome again to <i>Bergan Industries</i>, Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}.\"\r\n\r\nYou smile at Alys, \"Thank you, Ms Poole.  And thank you for the tempting offer to test <i>Last Rites</i> here on [[TGT_SYSTEM,{TGT_SYSTEM.Name}]].  Do I understand correctly that you will refit and rearm <i>Last Rites</i> at the conclusion of the exercise?\"\r\n\r\nAlys nods, the smile never leaving her face, \"That is correct, Commander.  You will not be held accountable for the costs of any damages to your mech or reloading ammo and other consumables, and we will also be covering the costs to the test site, the test units that will be fighting your mech, as well as the rest of the red tape that goes with having a sanctioned test zone on this planet.  You really have nothing to worry over and should be free to accept our offer to allow you to test <i>Last Rites</i> under a safe and controlled deployment zone.  What do you say?\"",
