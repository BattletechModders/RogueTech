    "Details": "<i>Last Rites</i> performed admirably in the Live Fire Exercise.  St Burt piloted the mech like it was an extension of his own body and left the targets smoking ruins.\r\n\r\nYou watch as <i>Last Rites</i> lumbers over to the contol bunker, amazed at how quick the mech is for something weighing in at 70 tons.  The mech comes to a stop and the hatch pops, St Burt clambers out to descend the ladder and you can see his grin even from where you are standing.\r\n\r\nYou look over to Alys Poole, and notice her restraining the unprofessional urge to rush over and hug St Burt, instead opting for hand shake and a subtle smile on her face.\r\n\r\n\"Amazing performance out there,\" you say to St Burt.  \"How'd it feel to get back in the saddle again?\"\r\n\r\nSt Burt can't wipe the grin off his face, \"<i>Last Rites</i> runs just as smooth as the original mech.  <i>Bergan Industries</i> did an amazing job putting it together!\"\r\n\r\nYou smile, \"Good to hear!\"  You turn towards Alys, \"Thank you for your assistance in rebuilding <i>Last Rites</i>.  It's time for us to get back out there and start making some C-Bills to keep this company afloat.\"\r\n\r\nAlys nods and smiles, \"I should thank you, Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}.  This little project has allowed Burt and I to reminisce.  Before you leave, if you are interested in making some C-Bills, we have a small job that is right up your alley.\"\r\n\r\nDarius leans closer to you, \"Commander, couldn't hurt to do a local mission before leaving [[TGT_SYSTEM,{TGT_SYSTEM.Name}]].  Of course, the decision is yours.\"",

Thank you again, Ms Poole.\""

Anything else we need to be aware of?\"\r\n\r\nAlys responds, \"The only other info we have is that there is a possible third party that may try to sweep in and steal any salvage left on the battlefield.
