I should have died then, but it was not yet my time.  Now, I have spent my off duty time searching records, schematics and Star Charts to hopefully rebuild <i>Last Rites</i> so I will no longer be <i>[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[Lore_Powless],powless]]</i> and I can once again be in command of a proper battlemech.\"\r\n\r\nYou raise an eyebrow at that last comment, \"Interesting, and what do you plan on doing now that you have this information?

I formally request permission to obtain the parts to rebuild <i>Last Rites</i>, a 70 ton custom Minsk MNK-102.  In return, I pledge, on my honour, to treat {COMPANY.CompanyName} as if it were my own Clan until I die.\"\r\n\r\nYou whistle slowly, \"That, my friend, is quite the request.  Tell you what, you get all the info together and we can discuss this again at that time.\"\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] reaches down and picks up a datapad and hands it to you, \"I have all of that information ready now, Commander.
