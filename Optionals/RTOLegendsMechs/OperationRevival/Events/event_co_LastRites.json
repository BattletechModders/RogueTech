    "Details": "You glance through the window pane as you pass by the library onboard the <i>Argo</i> and notice [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] surrounded by a mountain of manuals.  Your curiousity peaked, you decide to see what's going on and stroll over to {SCN_MW.Obj}.\r\n\r\n\"Greetings MechWarrior!\" you state as you approach the cluttered desk.\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] looks up from {SCN_MW.Det} work and smiles, \"Well met, Commander.  You were looking for me, quiaff?\"\r\n\r\nYou still find it hard to get used to clan language structure, but know enough to respect {SCN_MW.Det} beliefs and respond accordingly, \"Quineg, I was just passing by and noticed you deep in what appears to be a research project.  I have to admit, I'm curious to see what has captured your interest, if you care to share?\"\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] smiles, \"Aff Commander.  As you know, I came to be a part of your crew when you rescued me after I was rendered unconscious in battle.  While I appreciate you providing me with one of your company mechs, I feel I can be of more value to you, and to {COMPANY.CompanyName} if I had my original mech, <i>Last Rites</i>.\"\r\n\r\nYou nod, knowing most of this from [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]]'s personel file, \"Correct me if I am wrong, but wasn't your mech pretty much destroyed when Cloud Cobra attacked Rasalhague?\"\r\n\r\nYou can see the pain in {SCN_MW.Det} eyes at the mention of that famous battle, \"Aff Commander, it was.  I should have died then, but it was not yet my time.  Now, I have spent my off duty time searching records, schematics and Star Charts to hopefully rebuild <i>Last Rites</i> so I will no longer be <i>[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[Lore_Powless],powless]]</i> and I can once again be in command of a proper battlemech.\"\r\n\r\nYou raise an eyebrow at that last comment, \"Interesting, and what do you plan on doing now that you have this information?  You're contract with us is still active for quite some time you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aff, Commander,\" [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] responds.  \"That is why I am doing all the background work before submitting my formal request to you.\"\r\n\r\nYou smile, knowing where this is going, \"Let's just assume you've done all the background work already and skip straight to the request shall we?\"\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] smiles, \"Aff, Commander.  I formally request permission to obtain the parts to rebuild <i>Last Rites</i>, my 70 ton custom Minsk MNK-102.  In return, I pledge, on my honour, to treat {COMPANY.CompanyName} as if it were my own Clan until I die.\"\r\n\r\nYou whistle slowly, \"That, my friend, is quite the request.  Tell you what, you get all the info together and we can discuss this again at that time.\"\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] reaches down and picks up a datapad and hands it to you, \"Actually, I have all of that information ready now, Commander.  The necessary parts are located on 7 different star systems, with most of those in, or near, Rasalhague space.  We can go over the details now, quiaff?\"",
