    "Details": "The battle was a rough one, but in the end, your company prevailed.  You watch as your employer's medics check over the rescued hostages and conduct triage amongst the smoke and ruins.\r\n\r\nA hover-gurney laden with a wounded mechwarrior approaches you.  The medic stops in front of you and consults a datapad, \"Are you Commander {Commander.LastName}?\r\n\r\nYou look from the medic to the hover-gurney and back, \"Yes, I am Commander {Commander.LastName}.  Is there something you need?\"\r\n\r\nThe medic hands you the datapad and points at the screen, \"If you would please sign there, and there, and initial here, here and here.\"\r\n\r\nYou read over the data on the pad, \"What exactly am I signing for, and why are you asking me to sign this?\"\r\n\r\nThe medic looks confused, \"Just following orders, sir.  I was instructed to bring this patient to you and sign them over to your company.  My understanding is the last medivac dropship has left and this patient is missed catching a ride on it.  They have suffered severe burns and Post-Traumatic Amensia and if they stay here, they will most likely succumb to their wounds.\"\r\n\r\nYou look at the state of the patient, currently unconscious and drugged to nullify the sheer pain they must be going though.  You sign off on the datapad and hand it back to the medic, \"Thank you.  We will take good care of the patient.\"",
