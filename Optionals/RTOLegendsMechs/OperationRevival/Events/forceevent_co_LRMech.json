    "Details": "You walk into the morning briefing after having spent most of the previous night reading through the informaion on the datapad that [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] had given you.\r\n\r\nYou take your seat and breeze through the daily morning briefing.  As the briefing winds up, a knock on the door sounds, followed by the entrance of [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]], \"You requested my presence, quiaff Commander?\"\r\n\r\nYou motion for {SCN_MW.Obj} to come over to the table, \"Ok folks, we have a new project that [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] has brought to my attention.\"  You push some keys on the datapad and transfer the information to the holoscreen projected in front of everyone.\r\n\r\nMurmurs pass through those present, and you allow them time to digest the information before proceeding, \"What you are looking at here, is a plan to seek out specific components for use in rebuilding the mech that  [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] lost back on <i>Rasalhague</i> before {SCN_MW.Subj} came to work for us.\"\r\n\r\nSumire speaks up, \"Commander, there are seven systems I see listed there, with a range from just below Terra up to the outer reaches of Rasalhague space.  This will not be a cheap endeavor.\"\r\n\r\nYou nod, \"No, it won't, but it is also not time sensitive.  We can go to those systems at our leisure and when funds permit.  I have asked [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] here to go over the details so we can decide where we want to head to first.\"\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] takes your cue and addresses the command staff, \"Firstly, thank you for helping me rebuild my original mech, <i>Last Rites</i>.  As you can see on the display, there are eleven components needed that are available on six different star systems.\"\r\n\r\nYang interrupts, \"You can't build a mech with only eleven components!\"\r\n\r\n\"Aff, Yang Virtannen.\" [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] replies.  \"After we have obtained the components, we will need to go to <i>Rasalhague</i> to assemble them on a <i>Minsk MNK-102</i> chassis.  I still have a contact there who can do the necessary work.\" \r\n\r\n\"So where do you want us to go first then?\" ask Darius.\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] answers, \"It does not matter the order we collect the parts.  Here are the systems and their respective stellar coordinates so you all can choose where we go:\r\n\r\n<i><color=#FFBF00>ALPHA GROUP:\r\n\r\nElectronic Systems Facility on Galatea:   (-53.775,34.077) for 3 components;\r\n\r\nEngine Test Facility on Vipaava:  (61.258,370.634) for 2 components;\r\n\r\nRNR Metalworks on Radstadt:  (41.368,316.631) for 1 component;</color>\r\n\r\n<color=#FF7518>BETA GROUP:\r\n\r\nBallistics Testing Ammo Dump on Novaya Zemlya:  (180.681, -183.311) for 3 components;\r\n\r\nWeebleWobble Gyros on Gibbs:  (-201.11,157.892) for 1 component;\r\n\r\nInSight Targeting on Fletcher:  (46.777,-23.569) for 1 component</color></i>\"",
