    "Details": "The trip down to [[TGT_SYSTEM,{TGT_SYSTEM.Name}]] was as uneventful as last time.  Sumire heads directly to the private landing pad at the <i>Bergan Industires</i> facility.\r\n\r\nThis time, however, you are greeted by a stock standard <i>Bergan Industires</i> Liaison,  You don't even catch their name as you board the waiting <i>[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[Lore_BerganAPC],APC]]</i>.  At least it is the same luxury vehicle as last time, so you pour yourself a drink and sit back enjoying the ride in comfort.\r\n\r\nYou arrive at the facility and are escorted past numerous guards.  You can already see an amazing amount of repair work has been completed.  You soon arrive at your destination, the same glass walled room that overlooks one of the facility's production floors.\r\n\r\nYou see Alys and [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] standing beside their chairs at the table.  Alys smiles at you, \"Welcome again to <i>Bergan Industries</i>, Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}.\"\r\n\r\nYou smile at Alys, \"Thank you, Ms Poole.  We will not be taking up too much of your time.  We would like to be on our way as soon as possible.  Bills to pay, C-Bills to earn and all that.  You understand, don't you?\"\r\n\r\nAlys nods, the smile never leaving her face, \"Of course Commander.  But I would be remiss if I did not offer one last time the chance to test <i>Last Rites</i> under a safer and controlled deployment zone.  You sure you want to forego this opportunity?\"",
