You move forward to finally get a look at who you rescued with their bandages off, \"Greetings...\"\r\n\r\nThe patient smiles, \"You may call me Carson, Carson Lightfoot.  I owe you a great deal apparently, for getting me here to heal and recover.  Dr Richard says I would have died if you had not rescued me.\"\r\n\r\nYou smile, \"Anyone else would have done the same given the situation.  Do you know what happened? Or any other details?  Where you are from?  How did...\"\r\n\r\nDr Richard puts a hand on your shoulder, \"Commander, if you please, Mr Lightfoot needs his rest and he has not fully recovered all of his memories.  May we speak in private?\"\r\n\r\nYou nod, \"Of course Dr.\"  You turn back to the patient, \"Carson, continue to get better and we'll work out the details later, ok?\"\r\n\r\nCarson nods back at you as you turn and move into the corridor with Dr Richard.  You grin widely as you say, \"Ehh, what's up Doc?\"\r\n\r\nDr Richard, obviously not a humorous person, grimaces, then continues, \"Well Commander, as I said in there, Mr Lightfoot is technically ready for active duty now.  He has passed the vehicle simulator tests, but failed the mech tests.\"\r\n\r\n\"Explain <i>technically ready</i> in this context Doc,\" you state.\r\n\r\n\"Basically, he has been through a lot, both mentally and physically.  While he has passed all of the tests we've given him, the scores aren't amazing.  His PTSD will most likely manifest itself in combat as a need or desire to avoid as much incoming fire as possible, to the point that if he gets in an untennable situation, he may panic in battle.\"",
