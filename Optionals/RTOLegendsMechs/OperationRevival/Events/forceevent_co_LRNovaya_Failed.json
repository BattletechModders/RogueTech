Holding up your hand towards everyone, you look around with a steel-eyed gaze.  No one speaks, their mouths partially open but the words not forthcoming, before you eventually address those present, \"That, was a horrible display that makes us look as incompetant as a Capellan trying to stab someone in chest.  I don't even know where to begin with what snowballed into a disastrous result for {COMPANY.CompanyName}!\"\r\n\r\nYou are about to continue when Darius clears his throat and tentatively stands, interrupting your tirade, \"Uh, Commander, before you continue with the well deserved dressing down we all need, I just want to point out that we are being offered another chance to get the job done.\"\r\n\r\nYou choke back your pending outburst, \"What do you mean, <i>another chance</i>?  We failed the mission.  How can we <i>try again</i>?  This isn't a video game you know!\"\r\n\r\nDarius nods, \"Aye, Commander.  It would seem that the target convoy hasn't made it to their evac site.  Or more correctly, their dropship experienced technical difficulties and had to land in an area 50km east of their intended drop zone.  Support vehicles have arrived and the convoy is on the move to a new evac which means we get another shot and intercepting them.\"",
