    "Details": "You're relaxing in the lounge, enjoying a nice glass of [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreGBL],Glengarry Black Label]] when you see Yang enter the lounge obviously searching for someone.  His eyes lock onto you and he promptly heads you way.  When he gets to your table, you look up smiling, \"Looking for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes Boss,\" Yang responds.  \r\n\r\nYou motion for him to sit, \"Care for a glass?\"\r\n\r\nYang smiles as he sits down, \"You bet your ass I do!\"\r\n\r\nYou signal the waitstaff to bring over a glass for Yang and then turn back to him, \"So, you looked pretty focused on finding me, what's up? Something wrong in the MechBay?\"\r\n\r\nYang shakes his head, \"Gods no, Boss.  Running smooth as fresh coolant.  But, I have had some more responses to our enquiry about selling of [[DEAD_MW,{DEAD_MW.Callsign}]]'s <i>Minsk</i>.\r\n\r\nYou sit up straighter, more interested in the conversation now, \"Do tell.\"\r\n\r\nYang proceeds to relate the various offers and questions that have come in over the HPG network.  Eventually he comes to main reason for seeking you out, \"So Boss, there is a collecter here in [[TGT_SYSTEM,{TGT_SYSTEM.Name}]] that is very interested in <i>Last Rites</i> and they are willing to pay a decent chunk of change for it.\"\r\n\r\nYou take swig of your drink, \"How much are they offering?\"\r\n\r\nYang shrugs and slides over a datapad, \"They wouldn't say but they hinted at ¢1,500,000 which is way above any of the other offers we got.  I have their details on this datapad and they have asked that you contact them personally to discuss.  They also said this is a one time offer, so you need to act on it now.\"",

I'll get in touch with the Collector and get that mech sold.\"\r\n\r\nYou arrive back at your office and sit down at your desk.  You connect the datapad to your comm terminal and open the call register for the only contact listed.  You press the <color=#028A0F><i>CONNECT</i></color> button to initiate the call.  After a few moments, the spinning <color=#028A0F><i>CONNECTING</i></color> message is replaced by a view of a very oppulent lounge with floor to ceiling windows looking down on the cityscape of one of the larger metropolitan cites on [[TGT_SYSTEM,{TGT_SYSTEM.Name}]].  No audio appears to be transmitting, and you can see no one there. \"Hello?\" you ask.\r\n\r\nYou here some movement in the background before the view on the screen rotates to a figure hidden in the shadows.  \"Hello, Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}.  Thank you for getting back in touch with me.\"\r\n\r\nYou stare at the screen thinking, <i>rich people are weird</i> before snapping out of it, \"Uh, yeah, not a problem Mister...\"\r\n\r\nThe unknown figure you are talking to chuckles, \"No need for my name Commander.  I cannot afford any of my rivals to know where I obtain my collectibles from.  I'm sure you can understand this.  Now, lets just get right to it.  As I told your associate, I am willing to buy the stripped down chassis which was originally <i>Last Rites</i>, the custom Minsk of the former Khan of Clan Ghost Bear, [[DEAD_MW,{DEAD_MW.Callsign}]], for the sum of ¢500,000 C-Bills.\"\r\n\r\nYou start to laugh before catching yourself, \"I beg your pardon sir, but the asking price is ¢1,500,000 C-Bills.\"\r\n\r\nThe silence drags for what seems like an eternity before the figure responds, \"¢750,000 C-Bills.\"\r\n\r\nThe [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreGBL],Glengarry Black Label]] you had earlier steels your resolve and you hold your ground, \"This is a unique mech chassis.  We have other interested parties.  ¢1,500,000 C-Bills is our price.\"\r\n\r\nThe figure doesn't hesitate and starts to lean forward, \"Good luck with the other buyers, Commander.  Good Bye.\"\r\n\r\nYou quickly shout before they can terminate the call, \"¢1,200,000 C-Bills.  I have a Mercenary Company to run.\"\r\n\r\nThe shadowy figure leans back in their seat, and repeats their last offer \"¢750,000 C-Bills and this is my final offer Commander.\"\r\n\r\nNot wishing to lose out, you agree to the final sum and spend the next few hours signing digital paperwork to finalise the deal.\r\n\r\n<color=#E62E00><i>Last Rites</i> chassis has been sold and removed from storage</i>"
