    "Details": "Youâ€™re relaxing in the officers lounge, sipping a glass of [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreGBL],Glengarry Black Label]] when you see Darius enter the room, obviously looking for you as he heads your way, \"Commander, we have received a message from [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] care of <i>Bergan Industires</i>.  The work has been completed on <i>Last Rites</i>.   We can collect [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] and {SCN_MW.Det} mech at our leisure.\"\r\n\r\nYou down the last mouthful of your drink as you stand up, \"About bloody time.  I guess we should make preparations to collect [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] and {SCN_MW.Det} mech.  And find us a contract so we can make some coin while we see if this mech has been worth the trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Funny you should mention that.  Alys Poole has offered to let [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] test {SCN_MW.Det} mech in a live fire combat exercise so we can put <i>Last Rites</i> through a combat effectiveness test if you wish to accept,\" Darius mentions.\r\n\r\nYou raise your eyebrows, \"Live fire exercise?  Let me guess, any damage sustained is our responsibilty and no liability is to be held by <i>Bergan Industries</i>, am I right?\"\r\n\r\nDarius nods, \"Actually Commander,  they have agreed to refit and rearm <i>Last Rites</i> at the end of the exercise.  The decision is yours, Commander.\"",
