Thank you, let Dr Kixt know I'm on my way.\"  You stand up and head out the door towards the MedBays.\r\n\r\nYou arrive to see Dr Kixt and a number of MedTechs busy around the patient.  You move forward to finally get a look at who you rescued with their bandages off, \"Greetings...\"\r\n\r\nThe patient smiles, \"You may call me <color=#FFA500><i>Bryan, Bryan Michaels</i></color>.  I owe you a great deal apparently, for getting me here to heal and recover my memories.  Dr Kixt says I would have died if you had not rescued me.\"\r\n\r\nYou smile, \"Anyone else would have done the same given the situation.  Do you know what happened? Or any other details?  Where you are from?  How did...\"\r\n\r\nDr Kixt puts a hand on your shoulder, \"Commander, if you please, Mr Michaels still needs his rest and he has not fully recovered all of his memories.  May we speak in private?\"\r\n\r\nYou nod, \"Of course Dr.\"  You turn back to the patient, \"Bryan, continue to get better and we'll work out the details later, ok?\"\r\n\r\nBryan nods back at you as you turn and move into the corridor with Dr Kixt.  You grin widely as you say, \"Ehh, what's up Doc?\"\r\n\r\nDr Kixt, obviously not a humorous person, grimaces, then continues, \"Well Commander, as I said in there, Mr Michaels is technically ready for active duty now and he has passed both simulator tests for mechs and vehicles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Explain <i>technically ready</i> in this context Doc,\" you state.\r\n\r\n\"Basically, he has been through a lot, both mentally and physically.  While he has passed all of the tests we've given him, the scores aren't amazing.  He has suffered severe memory loss and also shows symptoms of PTSD that will most likely manifest itself in combat as a need or desire to avoid as much incoming fire as possible.  If he gets in an untennable situation such as being knocked down, he may likely to choose to eject from the mech.\"",
