    "Details": "An alert on your office com panel chimes and you reach over to display the message:\r\n\r\n<color=#00FFFF>CURRENT STELLAR POSITION:  -132.266, 1603.86, 0; Star System of [[TGT_SYSTEM,{TGT_SYSTEM.Name}]]</color>\r\n\r\nYou press another button on the com, \"Have [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] meet me on the bridge immediately.\"\r\n\r\nA few moments later you arrive on the bridge, the <i>Argo</i> slowly orbiting the main planet in the system of <i>{TGT_SYSTEM.Name}</i>.  At the sound of your name, you turn to see [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] approaching, \"Commander {COMMANDER.FirstName} {COMMANDER.LastName}, you requested my presence, quiaff?\"\r\n\r\n\"Welcome to the bridge, [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]].  We have arrived at <i>{TGT_SYSTEM.Name}</i>.  Sumire will need to know the coordinates of where we will be dropping.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aff, Commander {COMMANDER.FirstName} {COMMANDER.LastName}.  The area that needs to be scanned is 82.8628° S, 135.0000° E.  There should be an entrance to an underground facilty that will show up on your topography scans.\" [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] responds.\r\n\r\nOne of the techs calls out, \"Commander, I've located the facility, but scans are showing considerable damage to the entrance to the structure.\"\r\n\r\nBoth you and [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] shout at the same time, \"PUT IT ON THE MAIN SCREEN NOW.\"\r\n\r\nThe main viewscreen switches from the orbital view to a mountain ravine with a plume of thick black smoke spiralling into the clear sky.  You notice [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] start to issue an order, but then close {TGT_MW.Det} mouth, obviously not wanting to overstep {TGT_MW.Det} bounds again.  \"Increase magnification by 10,\" you call out.\r\n\r\nThe image zooms in, and you can clearly see that the facility has been attacked, with sufficient force to destroy the reinforced doors and allow egress inside.  You point at an area to the east of the smoking entrance, \"There, focus on that area.\"\r\n\r\nThe tech repositions the camera and zooms in to maximum.  Everyone can make out the obvious signs of a departing convoy, but landscape doesn't allow for any more information as the terrain obscures the viewing angle.\r\n\r\nDarius moves over to where you are standing, \"What are your orders, Commander?\"",
