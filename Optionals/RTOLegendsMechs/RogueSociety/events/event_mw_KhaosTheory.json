        "Details" : "You wander into the lounge for a drink and hopefully some relaxing music.  As you look around the crowded room, you easily notice the large form of a Ghost Bear MechWarrior motioning you to come join {TGT_MW.Obj}.\r\n\r\nYou stroll over and sit down across from [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] who effortlessly reaches across the table and politely slaps your shoulder, \"Greetings, Commander {COMMANDER.FirstName} {COMMANDER.LastName},  How are you this evening?\"\r\n\r\nYou stifle the wince on your face from the <i>friendly</i> slap, knowing its sting will leave a mark but not wanting to show any weakness to a man who commanded 1000's of warriors as Khan of Clan Ghost Bear, \"I'm fine, thank you.  How are you?\"\r\n\r\n[[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] pastes a big smile on {TGT_MW.Det} face, \"I am very well, thank you for asking Commander.  Have you ever tried <i>[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[Lore_GhostBeer],Ghost Beer]]</i>?\"\r\n\r\n[[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] holds up a massive pitcher of what looks like nothing but soda water.  You look at it and shake you head, \"Umm, no, no I have not.  It looks like soda water.\"\r\n\r\n{TGT_MW.Subj_C} grabs an empty tankard and fills it to the top, the clear liquid foaming over the edge the same way a normal beer would.  {TGT_MW.Det_C} smile nearly splits {TGT_MW.Det} face as {TGT_MW.Subj} pushes the drink over to you, and hoists {TGT_MW.Det} own full tankard, \"As you say in the Inner Sphere, <i>Cheers!</i>\"\r\n\r\nYou grab the offered tankard and carefully take a sniff.  Your eyes instantly water, offering you a valuable insight as to the potentcy of this particular beverage.  Not wanting to insult, you raise the tankard and tap it against {TGT_MW.Det}, \"Cheers!\"\r\n\r\n[[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] downs nearly half the tankard in one mouthful.  You try to mimic {TGT_MW.Obj}, but only manage the smallest of sips as the fiery liquid burns down your throat.  The coughing spasms wrack your body for what seems like forever before you catch your breath, \"Wha... What the bloody hell is in that?\"\r\n\r\n[[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] laughs, but not in a mocking way.  \"It does take some getting used to.  It is distilled from a grain that grows on <i>Arcadia</i> that is as white as driven snow.  The closest way to describe it would possibly be pure <i>carbonated vodka</i>.  It will warm your belly and put hair on your chest!  You want more, quiaff?\"\r\n\r\nYou're still catching your breath and politely respond, \"Uh... Neg.  Let me take my time and finish this tankard first.\"\r\n\r\n[[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] nods, empties {TGT_MW.Det} tankard and refills it, \"I have been wanting to speak to you for awhile, Commander.  I have a favour to ask and was hoping you would be willing to assist me.\"\r\n\r\nYou nod your head, \"Go on, tell me what you need and if it's reasonable we can see about accommodating you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not easily trust those who are not Clan Ghost Bear.  You, Commander, and your company, have shown similar tenets to those of my Clan:  Strength, Family and Patience.  It is because of this, I feel I can trust you with what I need help with.\" [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] says before pausing to take another drink.\r\n\r\nYou carefully sip your drink before speaking, \"Thank you for your comments, [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]].  Please continue, what is it you need from {COMPANY.CompanyName}?\"\r\n\r\n[[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] looks at you evenly, \"Commander, I humbly ask you to assist me in collecting my mech from storage.\"\r\n\r\nA confused look crosses your face, \"Why is your mech in storage?  And for that matter, why don't you just ask Yang to get the techs to ready it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Neg, Commander.  <i>MY</i> mech is not onboard the <i>Argo</i>.  It is where I left it, back in clan space.  I appreciate you giving me one of the {COMPANY.CompanyName} mechs to pilot, but I am now ready to pilot my mech again.\"\r\n\r\nYou sit back in your chair, digesting this information, \"May I ask why you left your mech behind in the first place?\"\r\n\r\n[[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] clears {TGT_MW.Det} throat, \"The various clans have differing views on those who are not clan.  To that end, I decided to travel away from my clan and experience the Inner Sphere under a different set of eyes.  To have done so whilst also piloting a customised 100 ton Kodiak would have skewed all perceptions of me and those I have met along the way.  I have gained perspective, and seen with my own eyes and heart that just because you are not clan, it does not mean you cannot embody the spirit of being clan.  I can see that in how you command your crew and company.\r\nI wish to continue experiencing the Inner Sphere with you and {COMPANY.CompanyName}.  With my mech, I can be a much more valuable asset for you to have at your disposal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wow, that is a lot to take in.  Which system in particular are we needing to travel to?\" you ask.\r\n\r\n[[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] calmly looks you straight in the eyes, \"I cannot divulge that information until you give me your word that you will assist, Commander.\"",
