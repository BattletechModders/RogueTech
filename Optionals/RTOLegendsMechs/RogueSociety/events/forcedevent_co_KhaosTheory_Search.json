Did we locate the stolen <i>Kodiak</i>?\"\r\n\r\nDarius looks at you neverously, \"No, Commander.  We still have crews searching the base, but have yet to find the <i>Kodiak</i>.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seriously?\" You shout. \"How hard is it to find a 100 ton mech.  The base isn't that big!\"\r\n\r\nDarius quickly scans his datapad, \"All intel shows that the convoy entered that base.  The <i>Kodiak</i> has to be there somewhere.  We presume the bandits have a hidden area somewhere which is why anyone coming around never noticed it was actually active.  We'll find it Commander, we just need a bit more time.\"\r\n\r\nYou snort, \"Hmph, more time you say.  Well, you are our <i>intel</i> specialist.  How long do you propose we will need to remain here in [[TGT_SYSTEM,{TGT_SYSTEM.Name}]]?\"\r\n\r\nDarius quickly responds, \"It should not take more than a few weeks at most to find.  There is a lot of rubble to shift which is hindering the search effort.\"",
