    "Details": "You're sitting at your desk going over various reports and inventories when you come across the datafile submitted to the MRBC regarding the death of [[DEAD_MW,{DEAD_MW.Callsign}]].  {DEAD_MW.Subj_C} {DEAD_MW.Gender?NonBinary:were|Default:was} a valued asset to {COMPANY.CompanyName}.  You reach over and press a button activating your comms: \"Yang, please report to my office.\"\r\n\r\nAbout 10 minutes later, Yang announces himself at your door, \"Boss, you wanted to see me?\"\r\n\r\nYou wave to the vacant chair, \"Come in, come in.  I know you are busy down in the mechbay, but what is the status of that <i>Kodiak</i> that belonged to [[DEAD_MW,{DEAD_MW.Callsign}]]?\"\r\n\r\nYang thinks for a moment, \"Well Boss, we tried nearly everything we could to get that mech combat ready, but there are too many components requiring a biometric access code that the chassis itself is currently one big doorstop.\"\r\n\r\nYou nod, \"You tried swapping out the cockpit and control systems I suppose?\"\r\n\r\nYang huffed, \"If you can think of it, know that my team and I gave it a darn good nudge.  Perhaps the only thing we didn't try was employing a cybernetic hacker.\"\r\n\r\nYou look confused, \"A what now?\"\r\n\r\nYang laughs, \"Hey, it's just a rumour bantered around the tech circuits.  You hear a whisper on one system or a rumour on another, but the gist of it is that somewhere out there are a crew that specialise in removing bio-locks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seriously?\" you ask.  \"And you think these people can remove the lock on the <i>Kodiak</i>?\"\r\n\r\nYang rubs his chin with his mechanical arm before stretching it out and examining it, \"Honestly Boss, I have no idea if it can be done.  It sounds possible.  I mean, my arm is bio-linked to me but I have no doubts that if I die, someone out there, if possible, will find a way to use it on someone else.\"\r\n\r\nYou lean back in your chair, \"So, we do not have the ability to unlock the <i>Kodiak</i> ourselves, and we do not know who can, other than unsubstantiated rumours.  What's your gut tell you?\"\r\n\r\nYang thinks for a bit, then responds, \"The way I see it Boss, we can sell the mech to a collector, we can just scrap it or we can do some poking around when we arrive at a system that has a known <i>Black Market</i> presence.\"",
