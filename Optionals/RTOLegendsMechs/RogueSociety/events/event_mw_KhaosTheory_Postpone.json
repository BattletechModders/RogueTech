As you find a vacant table and sit down, you notice [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] ordering a pitcher of what you know is <i>[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[Lore_GhostBeer],Ghost Beer]]</i>.  {TGT_MW.Subj_C} {TGT_MW.Gender?NonBinary:see|Default:sees} you, and begins to make {TGT_MW.Obj} way over to your table.\r\n\r\n\"Greetings, Commander {COMMANDER.FirstName} {COMMANDER.LastName},  I have not seen you here in some time.  May I join you?\"\r\n\r\nYou smile and wave at the vacant chair, \"Please, by all means.\"\r\n\r\n[[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] takes a seat and holds up the pitcher of  <i>[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[Lore_GhostBeer],Ghost Beer]]</i>, \"You would share this we me, quiaff?\"\r\n\r\nRecollecting that last time you drinks with [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] and the two day hangover that followed, you put on your best face and smile, \"Sure, why not?\"\r\n\r\n[[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] fills both of the tankards to the rim and slides one over to you.  You both cheers the glasses, and where you take a modest sip, the Ghost Bear Khan sitting across from you drains over half the tankard.  As {TGT_MW.Subj} sets his tankard down, a seriousness passes across {TGT_MW.Det} face, \"If I may be so bold, have you had a chance to consider my request, Commander.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not forgotten your request, but remind me, which system in particular are we needing to travel to?\" you ask.\r\n\r\n[[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] calmly looks you straight in the eyes, \"I still cannot divulge that information until you give me your word that you will assist, Commander.\"",
