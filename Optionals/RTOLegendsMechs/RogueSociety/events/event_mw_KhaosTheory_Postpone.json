You understand that heading out to clan space will take time, so this will not be a fast turn around mission?\"\r\n\r\n[[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] smiles and nods, \"Aff, Commander.  Ultimately, I am placing my faith in you honouring your word to assist me.

Do you trust me enough to provide the name of the star system?\r\n\r\n[[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] finishes {TGT_MW.Det} drink and sets the tankard down on the table, \"We need to go to <i>Radulov.</i>  A very remote location in the southern hemisphere to be a bit more precise.  When we arrive in system, I can provide more exact coordinates.\"\r\n\r\nYou lean forward, hand extended, \"This is where I think I should respond with, <i>Bargained well and done.</i>\"\r\n\r\nA massive grin spreads across [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]]'s face as {TGT_MW.Subj} nearly breaks your outstretched hand with {TGT_MW.Det} grasp, \"Aff, Commander! Bargained well and done!\"\r\n\r\nYou bid your farewell and stagger back to your cabin, the effects of just one tankard of <i>[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[Lore_GhostBeer],Ghost Beer]]</i> nearly buckling your knees.  You hope the inevitable hangover doesn't last too long while you  ponder how the hell  [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] can still function after polishing of nearly that whole pitcher.",
