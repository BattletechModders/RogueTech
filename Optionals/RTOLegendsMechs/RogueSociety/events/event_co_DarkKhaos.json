It does come across as odd that you would be in a bar for mechwarriors looking for employment.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Khan smiles, \u201CSuffice it to say that I needed a break from my duties as Khan of Clan Ghost Bear.  I still yearn for the cockpit of a mech and the roar of battle around me, so I thought to find a company I could loan myself out to that would scratch that itch. This is such a place and you are here to ask me to join your group, quiaff?\u201D\r\n\r\nYou nod, \u201CYes, I would be interested in having you as a member of my company.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Khan downs his drink, \u201CConvince me that your company is worthy, Commander\u2026\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCommander {Commander.FirstName} {Commander.LastName}\u201D, you respond. \r\n\r\nOver the next couple of hours, and many tankards of local ale, you and the Khan discuss the nuances of running a company versus being a Khan of a Clan.

Before you can say anything, Khan Darkan K\u2019Haos slides a tankard across to you, \u201CYou are curious as to why I am here and not with my clan, quiaff?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe clan dialect distracts you for a moment, as does the fact that this man seated, can still look you straight in the eyes without inclining his head when you are still standing. You sit down, now forced to look up to meet his gaze, \u201CUm, well, yes. It does come across as odd that you would be in a bar for mechwarriors looking for employment.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Khan smiles, \u201CSuffice it to say that I needed a break from my duties as Khan of Clan Ghost Bear.  I still yearn for the cockpit of a mech and the roar of battle around me, so I thought to find a company I could loan myself out to that would scratch that itch. This is such a place and you are here to ask me to join your group, quiaff?\u201D\r\n\r\nYou nod, \u201CYes, I would be interested in having you as a member of my company.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Khan downs his drink, \u201CConvince me that your company is worthy, Commander\u2026\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCommander {Commander.FirstName} {Commander.LastName}\u201D, you respond. \r\n\r\nOver the next couple of hours, and many tankards of local ale, you and the Khan discuss the nuances of running a company versus being a Khan of a Clan.  Towards the end of the evening, Khan Darkan K\u2019Haos extends his hand to you, \u201CCommander {Commander.FirstName} {Commander.LastName}, your vision appears aligned with my own.  I will join you and your company. Bargained well and done!\u201D\r\n\r\n<color=#f69c24>Hiring fee for Darkan K'Haos has been deducted from your account\r\n\r\nDarkan K'Haos is now in your barracks</color>",
