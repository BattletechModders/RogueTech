    "Details": "You and Darius are sitting quietly in a bar adjacent to the local hiring hall on [[TGT_SYSTEM,{TGT_SYSTEM.Name}]] when [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] returns with everyone’s drinks, a big smile on {SCN_MW.Det} face, “What gives, [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]]?” you ask. \r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] looks like a groupie at an UrbanMech Convention, “Commander, you will never guess who is sitting on the other side of the bar!”\r\n\r\nFeigning disinterest, you take a big sip of your drink, “Need a bit more information than that, Mechwarrior.”\r\n\r\n{SCN_MW.Subj_C} {SCN_MW.Gender?NonBinary:sit|Default:sits} down, still looking back across the bar, “Khan Darkan K’Haos!”\r\n\r\nYour blank look tells everyone you haven’t kept up with the who’s who of clan society.  Darius speaks up on your behalf, “The Khan of Clan Ghost Bear?”\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] beams, “Yes!! I’d bet my last C-Bill it’s him!!  I wonder why he’s here and not in clan space?”\r\n\r\nYou jokingly respond, “On holiday most likely.  I can imagine a chance to get away from all the headaches of being a khan would be a welcomed respite.”\r\n\r\nDarius looks over to the table where Khan Darkan K’Haos is sitting, “Well, he appears to be alone with none of his entourage in sight.  Maybe he is on holiday, as you suggest.”\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] speaks up, “Maybe… maybe he wants to hire on with a mercenary company?  Why else would he be here at a bar run by the MRBC?”\r\n\r\nDarius looks at you, “You know Commander, if [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] is right, he’d be a great asset for us.”",
