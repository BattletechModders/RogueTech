After a few moments of awkward silence, Darius clears his throat, \"Uh, Commander, we obviously underestimated this group of bandits.  Heck, even the Planetary Government couldn't even find them and...\"\r\n\r\nYou interupt him, \"Enough excuses.  We spent a bit of money getting out here to [[TGT_SYSTEM,{TGT_SYSTEM.Name}]] to retrieve <color=#E62E00>Dark Khaos'</color> <i>Kodiak</i> and we aren't leaving until we have it!\"\r\n\r\nSumire speaks up, \"The <i>Leopard</i> is ready to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boss, we'll need some time to make repairs if you want to use any the mechs from the initial attack run,\" Yang chimes in.\r\n\r\nDarius consults his datapad quickly, \"Commander, the Planetary Government still want that base captured and are willing to issue another contract to us.\"",
