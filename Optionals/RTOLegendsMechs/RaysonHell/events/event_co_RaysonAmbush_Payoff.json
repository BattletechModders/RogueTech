You rush to the bridge to see several fast-moving ships buzz past the bridge viewports. \r\nDarius looks at you, \"Commader, they are hailing us.  It's the same bandits we encountered awhile back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Open comms, Darius.\" you respond.\r\n\r\nThe shimmering cloaked figure once again addresses you through the holocom, \"Ah, Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}.  Welcome back again to my territory.  It is so very kind of you to come out this way again.  We do appreciate repeat customers, although I do need to inform you, the price for safe passage has doubled.\"\r\n\r\nYou stand your ground this time, \"What makes you think we will just give you our hard earned C-Bills this time?\"\r\n\r\nThe shimmering figure chuckles, \"Well, you paid before, so my money is on you paying again, Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}.  Just transfer the funds and you can go about your merry way.  Don't make me <i>touch up the paint</i> of that ancient shipwreck you're flying around in.\"",
