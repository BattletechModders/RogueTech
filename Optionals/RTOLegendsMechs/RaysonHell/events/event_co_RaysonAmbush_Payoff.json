Welcome back again to my territory.  It is so very kind of you to come out this way again.  We do appreciate repeat customers, although I do need to inform you, the price for safe passage has doubled.\"\r\n\r\nYou stand your ground this time, \"What makes you think we will just give you our hard earned C-Bills this time?\"\r\n\r\nThe shimmering figure chuckles, \"Well, you paid before, so my money is on you paying again, Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}.  Just transfer the funds and you can go about your merry way.  Don't make me <i>touch up the paint</i> of that ancient shipwreck you're flying around in.\"",

Sumire, LAUNCH!\"\r\n\r\nThe figure smiles, \"Let's dance, Commander!\"\r\n\r\nThe Leopard gracefully disengages from the <i>Argo</i>, unleashing a barrage of SRMs that streak through the cosmic expanse toward the marauding pirate ships. The agile bandit vessels elegantly dodge the incoming missiles while responding with a relentless onslaught, targeting both the Leopard and the <i>Argo</i>.\r\n\r\nThe relentless clash unfolds \u2013 lasers and SRMs painting a vivid spectacle against the backdrop of space. Amidst the chaos, a well-aimed volley from the Leopard finds its mark, brutally incapacitating one of the bandit ships. However, the <i>Argo</i> doesn't emerge unscathed.\r\n\r\nThe remaining assailants disengage. As they retreat, the mysterious leader transmits his parting message, \"You've wounded us, as we have wounded you, Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}.  Be seeing you soon...\"\r\n\r\nDarius calls out, \"Commander, we have sustained external damage to the <i>Argo</i>.\"\r\n\r\nYou acknowledge Darius' report as the pirate ships disappear into the starry distance, \"Any more updates as to who they are?\"\r\n\r\nDarius looks up from his panel and shrugs, \"Same as before Commander, Jamie Rayson and Mr Bubbles were a formidable team, and current rumors suggest that he will not stop until she is found.\"",
