But you haven't pissed me off yet, so I am willing to just take my payment and let you be on your way... keep at it, and well, you'll see just how much chaos I can cause.\"\r\n\r\nJust then, the Leopard leaps free from its docking collar on the side of the <i>Argo</i> and launches a barrage of LRMs at the pirate ships.  The ships evade the missiles, and return fire at the Leopard and <i>Argo</i>. The concetrated laser blasts pepper the hull as explosions near the engines resound throughout the <i>Argo</i>.\r\n\r\nThe dance continues until a particularly accurate barrage from the Leopard severly cripples one of the bandit ships.  The remaining ships form up around their wounded comrade and they peel off away from the <i>Argo</i>, the mysterious figure sending one final broadcast, \"I see you wish to test my resolve, Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}.  Mark my words, we <i>will</i> meet again.\"\r\n\r\nDarius calls out, \"Commander, we have sustained external damage to the <i>Argo</i>.\"\r\n\r\nAs the pirate ships disappear into the starry distance, you turn to Darius, \"Who were they and how the hell do they know who we are?\"\r\n\r\nDarius looks up from his panel and shrugs, \"We have no record of them in our database.  Even their ships had no markings or insignia.  The only reference I can find about bandit activity in this region refers to some elusive individual that goes by the name of Jamie Rayson and his partner Mr Bubbles and even that is nothing more than rumours.\"",
