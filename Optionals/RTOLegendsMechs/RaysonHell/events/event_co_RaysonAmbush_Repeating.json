Oh, and don't think your trick with your Leopard was as effective as you believe.

The agile bandit vessels elegantly dodge the incoming missiles while responding with a relentless onslaught, targeting both the Leopard and the <i>Argo</i>.\r\n\r\nThe relentless clash unfolds \u2013 lasers and SRMs painting a vivid spectacle against the backdrop of space. Amidst the chaos, a well-aimed volley from the Leopard finds its mark, brutally incapacitating one of the bandit ships. However, the <i>Argo</i> doesn't emerge unscathed.\r\n\r\nThe remaining assailants disengage. As they retreat, the mysterious leader transmits his parting message, \"You've wounded us, as we have wounded you, Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}.  Be seeing you soon...\"\r\n\r\nDarius calls out, \"Commander, we have sustained external damage to the <i>Argo</i>.\"\r\n\r\nYou acknowledge Darius' report as the pirate ships disappear into the starry distance, \"Any more updates as to who they are?\"\r\n\r\nDarius looks up from his panel and shrugs, \"Same as before Commander, Jamie Rayson and Mr Bubbles were a formidable team, and current rumors suggest that he will not stop until she is found.\"",
