We're back again, and ready for another little skirmish. So, are you going pay us double this time or will you risk your Leopard again?  Oh, and don't think your trick with your Leopard was as effective as you believe.  Send it out again, and we will get in some parting shots before we leave.\"\r\n\r\nAs the tension rises, Sumire remarks, \"Commander, they're not looking to negotiate this time. Should I prepare the Leopard for a more intense response?\"",
