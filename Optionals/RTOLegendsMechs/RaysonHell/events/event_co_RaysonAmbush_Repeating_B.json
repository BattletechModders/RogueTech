    "Details": "On the bridge of the Argo, alarms blare as the bandit aerospace fighters approach.  \r\n\r\nYou turn to Darius, \"Looks like they are never going to leave us alone, Hail them first before they can hail us.  Let's get this over with.\"\r\n\r\nDarius nods, \"Affirmative, Commander.  Patching them through now.\"\r\n\r\nThe holocam display flickers to life, showing the menacing visage of the bandit leader, obscured by a shimmering mask, \"Well, well, Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}. If I didn't know any better I'd think you were stalking me.  You want another skirmish or are you ready to pay up this time?\"\r\n\r\nYou can barely keep the anger from your voice, \"We fought you off last time and we will do it again.  Stand down and leave us and our ship alone.\"\r\n\r\nThe \nBandit Leader chuckles, \"My, my... aren't you the stubborn one, {COMMANDER.LastName}.  Whether you pay me, or pay the repair crews when we're done, it's going to cost you.\"\r\n\r\nYou smile back at the visage, \"How about this then... what if I have something that you need, like say, one of your valued <i>compatriots</i> here, onboard the <i>Argo</i>?\"\r\n\r\nThe image in the hologram is silent for what seems like a very long time before they answer, \"You have piqued my interest, Commander, so here's how this is going to go.  I think you're bluffing, but I'll give you a choice, put this <i>\"compatriot\"</i> into a sealed cargo pod and eject it for us to collect.  Once we verify their identity as someone of value, we will be on our way.  Or, just give us the ¢300,000 and stop wasting my time with your shenanigans.  Oh, and {COMMANDER.LastName} trickery and I will order MY dropship to open fire on yours.\"\r\n\r\nDarius calls out, \"Commander, a heavily modified Buccaneer Class dropship has just shown up on scanners heading our way!... it massively outguns us!\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll send the cargo pod over as soon as it's loaded,\" you say as you cut the feed.  \r\n\r\nAt that moment [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] arrives on the bridge, \"Commander, forgive the intrusion, but I think I know that bandit.\"\r\n\r\nYou smile at [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]], \"You're timing is impecable.  Seeing as there isn't much about this bandit, whom we are pretty sure is Jamie Rayson, what we can find mentions you as a comrade.  So my question is this, <i>'Are you loyal to {COMPANY.CompanyName} or are you loyal to Rayson?'</i>\"\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] responds, \"I haven't given you any reason to distrust me or my intentions in my time here.  I propose the following, if you trust me, I will talk him down and get him to join us.  I will need the ¢300,000 to convince him though.\"",
