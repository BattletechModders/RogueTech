    "Details": "<color=#BFBFBF>It arrives quietly. No fanfare. No signatures.\n\nA <i>Union</i>-class drop shuttle sets down on the far side of the <i>Dunianshire VI</i> logistics pad, logged under a clearly fake manifest. The pilot doesn’t disembark. Just waits while a series of sealed containers are offloaded and moved aboard the <i>Argo</i> by contract haulers who don’t speak a word.\n\nThe crew gathers in the hangar as the crates are pried open.\n\nInside the crates, the crew finds two full pallets stacked with hard-case C-Bills in untraceable denominations. Nestled beside them are several weapons case, foam-lined and without markings. The last container is heavier—an old, reinforced pressure case bearing faded [[DM.Factions[faction_SLDF],SLDF]] inventory codes. Farah eyes it immediately, already murmuring that she’ll need time to analyze whatever’s inside.\n\nTucked between two crates, on plain cardstock:</color> <color=#DFDFDF>“Best regards, AJ.”</color>\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>That’s all. No instructions. No authorization codes.\n\nJust enough to suggest a very deliberate silence.\n\nDarius scowls, folding his arms.</color> “So… that’s what a payoff looks like.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Yang gives a low grunt.</color> “She’s buying our quiet. And not even being subtle about it.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Farah doesn’t speak. She just stares at the SLDF container with quiet intensity.\n\nSumire half-smiles.</color> “You know... the Tribe never sent us hush money. Maybe we picked the wrong side.” <color=#BFBFBF>She pauses. Looks around.</color> “...Kidding. Probably.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>The tension doesn’t break.\n\nYou can feel it—uncertainty creeping in at the edges of the crew. About the war. About Arelle. About what comes next.\n\nFor now, everyone returns to their stations. But the quiet isn’t just silence. It’s doubt.</color>",
