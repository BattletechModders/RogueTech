With the [[DM.Factions[faction_MinnesotaTribe],Tribe]]’s logistics disrupted at <i>Landrum</i>, they’re falling back toward stronger defensive positions. We can’t give them the space to dig in.”</color>\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>A digital overlay highlights the system of <i>Fröislandis</i>, spinning slowly in the <i>Argo</i>’s tactical holosphere.</color>\n\n<color=#DFDFDF>“We’ve located one of the Tribe’s primary manufacturing complexes on <i>Fröislandis VII</i>. Our analysis confirms the site is producing a steady stream of combat units—if left unchecked, it will tip the balance. Your next objective is to eliminate the facility before production scales further. You are to depart immediately. There is no time left to waste.”</color>\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Darius frowns as the data packet finishes decrypting.</color> “One of their main plants? That’s not a strike, that’s a decapitation.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Farah mutters,</color> “If they built that on Fröislandis, then we’ve been underestimating how much they’ve dug in out there.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Sumire glances toward the nav console, already prepping the next jump.</color> “Hope our MechWarriors are well rested. This won’t be a soft drop.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>The next move is clear. The Tribe’s machines must be silenced—at the source.</color>",

Thin atmosphere, hostile cold, and a dense asteroid ring in orbit—nothing you’d expect to be worth fighting over. Only point of interest before the Tribe moved in was a fringe research outpost studying extremophile fungi. One strain in particular showed promise as a protein-rich food base for cryogenic colony worlds.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>She scrolls further, lips tightening.</color> “The team built a small agricultural and packaging lab to test growth and viability, but all contact with the site dropped off six months ago. No distress call. No comms. Just silence.” <color=#BFBFBF>She looks up.</color> “And now we know why.”\n\n<b><color=#F79B25>[A Flashpoint is now available in the Fröislandis system]</color></b>"
