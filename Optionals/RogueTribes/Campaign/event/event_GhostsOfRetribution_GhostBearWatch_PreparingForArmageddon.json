    "Details": "<color=#BFBFBF>A supply shuttle latches onto the <i>Argo</i>’s lower bay with a metallic clang. Its manifest is thin—just a single crate, labeled in Ghost Bear Watch encryptions. Inside: a handful of salvaged systems, replacement components, and a diagnostic slate with a single message burned into its welcome screen.</color>\n\n<color=#DFDFDF>“Commander,\n\nThis is all I can spare. My forces are spent. If you’re reading this, then the end is near—one way or another.\n\n—Arelle”</color>\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Darius grimaces as you lower the slate.</color> “That’s not encouraging.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Moments later, Sumire calls out.</color> “Commander. New hyperpulse signal. Extreme level of encryption... origin unknown. Looks like it’s for us.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>The message plays.\n\nMizuki Bekker appears in monochrome, standing in some dim, windblown corridor. Her voice is calm—too calm.</color>\n\n<color=#DFDFDF>“You’ve come far, but this is where it ends. You have no idea what you’re walking into. That machine. You can maybe stop it, but you can't stop the others.”</color>\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>She pauses, then leans forward, her eyes hard.</color>\n\n<color=#DFDFDF>“You will not survive what comes next.”</color>\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>The message cuts out.\n\nYang growls.</color> “Damn it. That didn’t sound like bluff.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Farah crosses her arms.</color> “She’s nervous. You don’t send warnings if you’re not afraid.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Sumire shakes her head.</color> “Too late now, either way. We’ve come too far.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Darius looks to you.</color> “I agree, Commander. We have no choice but to finish what we started.”",
