    "Details": "<color=#BFBFBF>Just as you are about to settle for a peaceful dinner in the messhall, a high-priority message arrives.\n\nHolo-headers mark it as official correspondence from the <i>[[TGT_SYSTEM.OwerDef,{TGT_SYSTEM.OwnerDef.Demonym}]] Office of Planetary Oversight</i> on <i>Dunianshire VI</i>. The speaker is a tall, sharp-featured woman dressed in a rose-gold {TGT_SYSTEM.OwnerDef.Demonym} bureaucrat’s uniform—polished, poised, and clearly reading from a prepared script.</color>\n\n\n<color=#DFDFDF>“To the command of {COMPANY.CompanyName},\n\nYou are formally notified that your unit initiated unsanctioned combat operations within the territorial jurisdiction of the {TGT_SYSTEM.OwnerDef.Name}.\n\nPlanetary authorities have received multiple reports indicating your forces engaged what appears to be a licensed independent security contractor under false pretense.\n\nEffective immediately, a provisional lien in the amount of 4 billion C-Bills is being placed against your organization pending full investigation.\n\n - Senior Attaché Halyn Vorelli.”</color>\n\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>The feed ends. No negotiation. No recourse.\n\nDarius lets out a low whistle.</color>\n\n“That’s... extortion with extra steps.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Farah frowns over the tactical data from the mission.</color> “The entire [[DM.Factions[faction_MinnesotaTribe],Tribe]] force was running in complete false flag mode, transponders, colors—even the mech chassis numbers. I could see why someone would be fooled by this.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Sumire leans against the console.</color> “Four billion? That’s not a fine, that’s what you’d charge for glassing a city.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Yang scoffs.</color> “They don’t want money. They want us scared enough to start talking.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>The timing’s no accident. Someone in {TGT_SYSTEM.OwnerDef.ShortName} suspects there’s more to this fight than mercs shooting mercs. They just don’t know what it is—and they’re desperate to learn.\n\nBut it is strange—the local government should have been informed by Arelle by now. There’s only one person who’ll know the answer. It’s time to contact Arelle.</color>",
