    "Details": "<color=#BFBFBF>Weeks pass aboard the <i>Argo</i> in tense quiet. Contracts roll in, systems get overhauled, the crew drifts back into the routines of downtime—yet no one quite relaxes. The [[DM.Factions[faction_MinnesotaTribe],Minnesota Tribe]] has gone dark since the last campaign. No broadcasts. No incursions. No retaliation.\n\nThat changes with the arrival of a sealed transmission—stamped </b>Classified: Watch Cipher Omega-Black</b>. One of the most secure protocols Arelle has provided, requiring a multi-part decryption key with biometric components.\n\nThe attached [[DM.Factions[faction_GhostBearWatch],Ghost Bear Watch]] briefing is meticulous and alarming.\n\nThe Minnesota Tribe has launched a major coordinated operation, designated <i>Operation Cobra Strike</i>. Without warning, they seized control of several colony worlds far closer to the Inner Sphere than their previous holdings—some within jump distance of major trade corridors. Each strike unfolded with surgical precision: small units, heavy tonnage, zero warning.\n\nFrom these footholds, they initiated a synchronized wave of deep raids across multiple sectors. Munitions depots. Forward command posts. Sensor networks. Even limited strikes within the borders of the Great Houses. The timing of each hit was near-perfect, and the identity of the attackers remained ambiguous long enough to paralyze defenses.\n\nAccording to the Watch, these raids completely bypassed the outer systems the crew had helped retake. <i>Horgens</i>, <i>Star Cluster 752</i>, <i>Rim Worlds Republic Outpost #11</i>—all untouched. The Watch seems to have no explanation for how they slipped past Ghost Bear lines without triggering alarms.\n\nFalse transponder codes. Repainted hulls. Silent jumps. It’s clear the Tribe’s veil of secrecy has not only held—it’s gotten stronger.\n\nAs Darius scans the report, his jaw tightens.</color>\n\n“This wasn’t a reaction. It was well prepared. And we’re behind again.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>He glances toward the comms array.</color> “We better head back to <i>Melidron</i>. I bet we’re going to hear from Arelle soon.”",
