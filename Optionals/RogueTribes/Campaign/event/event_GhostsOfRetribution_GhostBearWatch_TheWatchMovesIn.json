Your actions were instrumental.\n\nNext objective lies within the <i>Malador Cluster</i> system. Scans have identified rare raw material deposits on the barren planet designated <i>Kuras Drift</i>—materials not seen outside classified vaults. The Tribe is already there. We must strike quickly, before they can exploit or extract it.\n\nExpect resistance. They will not surrender these resources easily.”</color>",

            "Details": "<color=#BFBFBF>The databanks only have a small entry on the planet called <i>Kuras Drift</i>.\n\nIt is a small, rocky planet in the outer edge of the <i>Malador Cluster</i> system. It lacks a stable atmosphere—its surface is exposed to deep vacuum in most regions. However, gravitational interactions with the nearby gas giant <i>Malador’s Eye</i> produce rare \"tidal pockets\" of loosely held atmospheric gases that gather temporarily in crater basins and lowland fractures. These pressure zones are weak and unstable, offering little more than temporary shelter from hard vacuum.\n\n<i>Kuras Drift</i> has no known settlements or structures. Its geological profile is harsh and ancient, consisting of fractured bedrock and deep impact scars. Though long ignored, recent scans suggest the presence of rare raw materials beneath the crust, and the planet have been marked by several large companies for possible future exploitation.</color>\n\n\n<color=#F79B25><b>[A flashpoint has been created in the <i>Maladon Cluster</i> system for the next step of the campaign]</b></color>"
