    "Details": "<color=#BFBFBF>An encrypted packet arrives quickly after the call with Arelle ended—coordinates, mission tags, and a name that sent an immediate ripple through the crew: [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMajestyMetals],Majesty Metals and Manufacturing]]. It's another major corporation, will this be [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreVicore],Vicore]] all over?\n\nThe crew gathers around the holotable as jump preparation alerts begin to echo through the <i>Argo</i>’s corridors.\n\nYang leans in, expression wary.</color> “<i>Dunianshire VI</i>. That’s no fringe outpost. <i>Majesty Metals</i> is one of the biggest industrial players in the Inner Sphere, even out here on the edge. They make everything—‘Mech chassis, armored plating, weapon frameworks, even bulk atmospheric components. If they’ve got a vault hidden there, it’s not just valuable—it’s probably cutting-edge.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Farah taps a readout, frowning.</color> “The vault’s buried under one of their older prototype facilities, tied into <b>Factory Circumference Alpha</b> right outside [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreGiggleswick],Giggleswick]]. That’s an R&D spine for their assault mech division. Might be weapon schematics, maybe structural enhancements... but definitely something the [[DM.Factions[faction_MinnesotaTribe],Tribe]] wants intact.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Sumire raises an eyebrow.</color> “Wait—does [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Dunianshire].OwnerValue.FactionDef,{DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Dunianshire].OwnerValue.FactionDef.Name}]] even know we’re coming? <i>Dunianshire</i> is their space. And what about Majesty’s own security teams? If they see our 'Mechs stomping toward one of their black sites, are we sure they won’t open fire?”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Silence follows, no one answers. You all glance at one another.\n\nDarius shrugs.</color> “We’ve got coordinates, authorization tags, and a job. We’ll have to trust Arelle squared things on her end.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Sumire mutters,</color> “Right. Trust the Watch. Never goes wrong.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>You nod. The decision’s made. The <i>Argo</i>’s course is locked. Majesty’s vault waits on <i>Dunianshire VI</i>—and whatever’s inside, the Minnesota Tribe is already on the move.</color>",
