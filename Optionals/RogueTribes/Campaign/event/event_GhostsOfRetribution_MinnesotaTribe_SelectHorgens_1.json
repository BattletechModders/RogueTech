    "Details": "<color=#BFBFBF>The <i>Argo</i> enters orbit above <i>Horgens III</i>, the third planet in the system and barely more than a fledgling colony. Far below, dense lowland jungles and shallow coastal floodplains stretch between narrow strips of prefabricated structures—the earliest bones of a scattered, agrarian economy. Rainfall veils much of the surface, forming shifting fog banks that ripple through river deltas and cling to newly raised rooftops.\n\nThere are no major cities here. No real defenses. Just scattered settlements clinging to humid ground—and the Tribe’s hidden staging zones buried in the canopy.\n\nA secured Hyperpulse transmission arrives moments later. Mizuki Bekker’s image flickers into view, her tone as measured as ever.</color>\n\n“Horgens is more than just a humid backwater. It’s becoming a nerve center for our expansion—and the [[DM.Factions[faction_GhostBearWatch],Ghost Bears]] know it. They’ve launched a multi-pronged push to destabilize everything we’ve built there.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>She brings up a flickering display of tactical readouts, one after the other.</color>\n\n“First, we have a convoy hauling food and ammunition to a forward depot. It’s ready to leave, but Watch ambushers are tightening their noose. You’ll need to get that convoy through.\nSecond, our command node—freshly established and still half-buried in the jungle—is under direct threat. They’re planning a concentrated strike. If they breach that facility, the entire chain of coordination on <i>Horgens</i> collapses.\nAnd third, one of our scout teams went dark just hours ago. They were carrying sensitive base schematics. If they’re captured—or silenced—our defenses are compromised before they’ve even solidified.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>She leans forward slightly, voice firm.</color>\n\n“All three missions must be completed. But you choose where to begin. Once a contract is issued, it must be launched within <b>fourteen days</b>. Fail to act in time, and the window closes.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>A pause.</color> “You will be rewarded after each strike. Weapons, tech, support assets—what we can spare. Just hold this ground. Every inch of it matters.”",
