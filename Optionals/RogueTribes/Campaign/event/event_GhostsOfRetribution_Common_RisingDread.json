Just silence—and the faint hum of the <i>Argo</i>’s systems.\n\nDarius exhales through his nose, arms crossed.</color> “This is spiraling. Fast. We’re talking coordinated strikes against a rogue Clan... and she expects us to be the tip of the spear?”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Sumire leans against the console, glancing toward the viewport.</color> “And if we say no? What happens then? She doesn’t strike me as the ‘let bygones be bygones’ type.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Yang grunts.</color> “The [[DM.Factions[faction_GhostBearWatch],Ghost Bear Watch]] doesn’t leave debts unsettled. And she sees this whole thing as a matter of blood and honor. If we bail now, we don’t just walk—we run. And we keep running.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Farah taps her datapad with restless fingers.</color> “We’re in deeper than salvage and payouts now. This is something else. Old ghosts. Buried wars. And one misstep could light the whole thing off.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>No one speaks for a long moment.\n\nEventually, all eyes shift to you, the commander.\n\nDarius speaks again, voice low.</color> “Look... you’ve gotten us through worse than this. We trust you, {COMMANDER.CallSign}. Just tell us where we’re going.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Whatever comes next—strike deep or vanish into the black—they’ll follow. But the weight of that choice presses heavier than ever.</color>",
