    "Details": "<color=#BFBFBF>A high-priority burst from the Watch cuts in—Arelle’s voice arrives crisp, but under strain.</color>\n\n“This will be brief. The [[DM.Factions[faction_GhostBearWatch],Watch]] has secured three systems—<i>Doggerbank</i>, <i>Star Cluster 814</i> and <i>Malador Cluster</i>. Each forward base is operational, though stretched thin.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>She pauses, then continues with unusual intensity.</color>\n\n“But the Tribe is not standing still. They've initiated a fallback strategy—clean withdrawals, taking equipment, personnel, and even stripped habitats. We're seeing patterns of deliberate denial, ensuring we can not use anything left behind against them.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>A readout appears showing marked systems shifting in control.</color>\n\n“They’ve now seized control of <i>Gurgaldar</i>, <i>Fröislandis</i>, <i>Tansalir</i>, and <i>Brundams</i>. All systems with prior fringe activity—now completely overrun.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>She exhales.</color>\n\n“Which brings us to <i>Landrum</i>. Intelligence shows a logistics hub in flux. Tribe formations are transiting through, reorganizing and resupplying before disappearing again. Strike now, and we catch them before they scatter.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>She closes with a sharp nod.</color>\n\n“Your target is not infrastructure. It’s the forces themselves. Break their cohesion. You deploy immediately.”",

            "Details": "<color=#BFBFBF>Farah steps onto the bridge, datapad already in hand, and silently offers it to you.</color>\n\n“There’s not a lot on <i>Landrum II</i>,” <color=#BFBFBF>she says, voice quiet but firm.</color> “It’s a medium-sized arid planet with two moons—both in irregular orbits thanks to gravitational interference from a nearby gas giant. Most of the surface is dominated by massive inland saltflats. Over time they’ve steadily contaminated the oceans with runoff, pushing salinity through the roof. Only the coasts manage any real vegetation.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>She shifts her weight, brow furrowing slightly.</color>\n\n“The locals live simple—primitive, really. Tech level’s like early 21st-century <i>Terra</i>. Scattered settlements, no major cities, and practically no infrastructure. Nothing you'd expect a major operation to care about.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>She pauses, then adds,</color> “There’s one curiosity—an enormous sponge-like fungus that grows in crevices beneath the surface. The mycelial networks stretch for kilometers underground, but no one’s ever found a use for it. Research teams pulled out years ago.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>She looks up from the datapad.</color> “So either the Tribe is hiding something they don’t want found... or they’re using this place for logistics because nobody else ever would.”"
