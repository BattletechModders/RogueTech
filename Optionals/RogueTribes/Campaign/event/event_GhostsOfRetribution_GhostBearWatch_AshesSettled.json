Everything from polar tundra and alpine slopes to badlands, jungles, and lowland forests. Pretty on the surface—deadly once the weather rolls in.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>She swipes to another screen.</color> “The atmosphere’s unstable. Constant electrical storms, high static charge, interference so strong it bricks half your sensors. Star League used to run weather stations here. Most are ruins now—fried by the storms or torn down by time.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>She shows a strange violet flower blooming from a bed of frost.</color> “This is the <i>tundra witch</i>. Native to the cold zones. Its pollen’s psychoactive—triggers hallucinations in most species. Draws megafauna like a magnet. Massive grazers that’ll stampede over anything that moves.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>She gives a short breath.</color> “Smugglers still come in, trying to harvest the pollen for narcotics. Most vanish. Either taken by the storms, or trampled into mulch.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Farah meets your eyes.</color> “If the Tribe’s working here, it’s not random. They’re hiding something… and they’re hoping the planet keeps it hidden.”\n\n<b><color=#F79B25>[A new flashpoint has been created in the <i>Cygnus</i> system, head there for the contract]</color></b>"
