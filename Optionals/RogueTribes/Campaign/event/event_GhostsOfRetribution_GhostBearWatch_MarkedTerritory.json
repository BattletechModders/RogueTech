    "Details": "<color=#BFBFBF>The Argo settles into high orbit above {TGT_SYSTEM.Name}. Most of the crew is off-duty or dispersed across the ship, but on the bridge, only Farah and you remain—running post-jump diagnostics in relative quiet.\n\nThen the signal hits—a high-priority encrypted data burst, routed through a [[DM.Factions[faction_GhostBearWatch],Ghost Bear Watch]] relay. No signature. No authentication header. Just a blunt, silent transmission demanding attention.\n\nFarah isolates the file and applies the decryption key Arelle had granted weeks ago. The system responds immediately. Lines of tactical intelligence unfold across the main display: sightings, signal traces, combat telemetry—all tied to thirteen different systems where [[DM.Factions[faction_MinnesotaTribe],Minnesota Tribe]] activity has been confirmed in the last sixty days.\n\nIt’s precise. Cold. Watch-grade formatting.\n\nAnd then—tucked near the bottom of the packet—one very surprising line.</color>\n\n<color=#DFDFDF>“System Status: MELIDRON – Occupied. Ghost Bear Watch Forward Command Active.”</color>\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Farah glances at you, brow furrowed.</color> “Since when does the Watch list themselves like that? I thought shadow ops were supposed to stay in the shadows.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>The screen hums, still displaying the Ghost Bear emblem over a planet you just left.\n\nWhatever’s happening out there—the masks are starting to slip.</color>",
