Says she’s turned something up—nothing concrete yet, but enough that she wants to talk through it with you directly.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>He pauses, glancing at the tablet, then back at you.</color>\n\n“She asked for a sit-down, soon. Says some of the details aren’t adding up the way they should. And judging by the look on her face... whatever she found, it’s not good news.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>He tucks the tablet under his arm, waiting for your call.</color>\n\n“Your move, Commander.”",

Now.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>There's a short pause before the replies filter in—acknowledgments from Sumire, Farah, and finally Yang. You can hear it in their voices: tension, curiosity, maybe even a trace of unease.\n\nMinutes later, the crew files into the room one by one. Sumire arrives first, arms folded, trying to mask her worry with a half-smirk that doesn’t quite land. Yang trudges in next, wiping grease from his hands with a rag, muttering under his breath about \"damn ghost-tech.\" Darius is all business, eyes sharp, posture rigid. And Farah—Farah enters last, data pad tucked tightly under one arm, jaw clenched, her usual calm tinged with urgency.\n\nThey take their seats without a word. The air is heavy.\n\nYou lean forward, meeting their eyes in turn.</color>\n\n“Let’s hear what you’ve got, Farah.”"
