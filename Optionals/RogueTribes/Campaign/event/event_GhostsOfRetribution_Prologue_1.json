The posting lists a name: Mizuki Bekker. No faction affiliation, no planetary tag, no routing origin. Just that name, and a mission brief marked eyes-only.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>He taps a few keys and brings up the sparse dossier.</color> “The offer’s legit. High-priority assault on a lightly defended convoy. No salvage rights, but the pay’s outrageous—well above MRBC scale. It even includes a clean bonus clause.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>He straightens, still uneasy.</color>\n\n“I’ve never seen a contract routed like this. Feels like it was dropped right into our queue by someone who knew exactly how to bypass the filters. And that name… Mizuki Bekker? Never heard of them. No records, no history.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>He frowns, voice dropping slightly.</color> “I don’t like ghosts, Commander. But that amount of C-bills is hard to ignore.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>He waits for your response, the flicker of unease lingering behind his eyes.</color>\n\n<b><color=blue>[If the mysterious contract is not completed before it disappears from the command center, this event will appear again after some time. The contract can only be completed once, and once the contract is completed this event will stop appearing.]</color></b>",
