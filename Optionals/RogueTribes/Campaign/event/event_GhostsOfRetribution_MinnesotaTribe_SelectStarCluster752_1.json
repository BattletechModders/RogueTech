    "Details": "<color=#BFBFBF>The screen flares to life with a burst of static, then clears to reveal Mizuki Bekker once again. Her tone is direct, sharpened by urgency.</color>\n\n“<i>Star Cluster 752</i> is now on the front line. We have three key objectives that must be completed in sequence. I will not mince words—each of these tasks is vital to preserving our hold on this world, and all of them will fall to you.\n\nFirst, we must intercept [[DM.Factions[faction_GhostBearWatch],Ghost Bear]] raiders on the way to our desert forward operations camp. Then, we need to recover sensitive data buried beneath the sands—data the Ghost Bears would use to overwhelm our defenses. Finally, the planet's main logistics redoubt must be defended at all costs. If it falls, our operational reach collapses.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>She pauses, gaze intense.</color>\n\n“You choose the order. But know this: once issued, each contract must be launched within <b>two weeks</b>. Delay, and the opportunity—and the advantage—is lost. After each success, a small cache will be provided. Weapons, custom tech, ammunition—tools to keep you in the fight.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>She leans forward slightly.</color> “This is where we make our stand. Choose your next strike.”",
