Instead, your personal datapad is flashing.\n\nA new message, with the Subject <b>FOR YOUR EYES ONLY</b>.\n\nNo senders listed. No traceable headers. Just a single embedded file. Against your better judgment, you open it.\n\nIt’s text-only. No signature. No voice. But you recognize the cadence instantly—and the symbol at the bottom removes all doubt: the crest of the [[DM.Factions[faction_MinnesotaTribe],Minnesota Tribe]].</color>\n\n\n<color=#DFDFDF>“You didn’t believe me when I told you what the Ghost Bears are willing to hide. But now you’ve seen it firsthand.\n\nYour handler has admitted to violating her own Clan’s command structure. She has endangered your outfit, your reputation, and your future for her own crusade. And she never told you why.\n\nI would like to speak again.\n\nThis time, I will bring you more of the truth. Things Arelle will never tell you.\n\nSpeak to no one before deciding. This offer is only for you.”</color>\n\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>You read it twice. Then a third time.\n\nShe knows. About the call with Arelle. The 4 billion. The confession.\n\nYou haven’t spoken to anyone outside the crew. That message was buried in encrypted transmission layers.\n\nAnd yet... Mizuki knows.\n\nYou consider your options.</color>",
