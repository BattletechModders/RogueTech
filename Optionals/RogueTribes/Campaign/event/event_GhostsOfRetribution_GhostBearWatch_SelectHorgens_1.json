    "Details": "<color=#BFBFBF>The <i>Argo</i> eases into orbit above <i>Horgens III</i>, the third planet in the <i>Horgens</i> system. Below, the surface brims with equatorial jungles and sprawling lowland basins—heavy with moisture, layered in fog, and riddled with flooded deltas. The planet is still young in colonial terms: minimal infrastructure, scattered settlements clinging to riverbanks, and no standing militia to resist a determined push.\n\n[[DM.Factions[faction_MinnesotaTribe],The Minnesota Tribe]] has used that vulnerability well. Beneath the canopy, they've carved out staging grounds and hidden command centers, repurposing old survey bunkers and abandoned prefabs.</color>\n\n“Commander {COMMANDER.Callsign}. Welcome to <i>Horgens</i>. The Tribe’s presence here is light, but embedded. Forward depots, staging trails, relay points—small anchors spread across an undeveloped world. You will break them one by one.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>The tactical overlay flashes. Three red markers highlight key sites.</color>\n\n“One target is a supply convoy en route to a depot. You’ll strike mid-transit—cripple their logistics chain before it tightens.”\n\n“Another is a regional command site under construction. Incomplete, exposed. Capture it before they finish bringing it online.”\n\n“The third is a lone scout carrying sensitive data. They’re attempting to reach extraction. Stop them—we need that intel.”\n\nShe returns her gaze to the Commander.\n\n“You will complete all three operations. This is just the first blow. Choose where to land.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>A pause. Her voice lowers slightly.</color>\n\n“You’ll have <b>14 days</b> to begin. After each operation, you’ll receive a bonus—captured tech, equipment, supplies. The Watch does not waste success.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>The transmission cuts.</color>",
