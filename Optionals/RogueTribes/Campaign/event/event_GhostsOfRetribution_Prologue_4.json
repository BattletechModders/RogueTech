Star Colonel Arelle Jorgensson appeared a moment later, her posture rigid, her tone sharper than ever.</color>\n\n“You will depart for <i>Maisons</i> immediately,” <color=#BFBFBF>she says.</color> “The longer you delay, the greater the chance the evidence will be lost or compromised. This is not a flexible window.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>You scanned the nav data and clenched your jaw. Travel wasn't cheap, and Jorgensson hadn’t mentioned anything about covering jump fees or downtime. You decided to press the point.</color>\n\n“Will the [[DM.Factions[faction_GhostBearWatch],Ghost Bears]] be covering the travel costs?”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>A loaded pause full of silence follows. Her eyes narrow.</color>\n\n“On this single occasion, I will lower myself to subsidize mercenary transit. But only if departure is immediate. Hesitate, and you will pay your own way.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>The channel cuts out before you can answer. You give the order to prepare for launch. Whatever waits on <i>Maisons</i>, it has the Ghost Bear Watch rattled enough to pay you not to hesitate. That alone is worth noting.</color>",
