    "Details": "<color=#BFBFBF>A priority message flags itself on your command terminal before you’ve even finished the debrief. No encryption handshake. No Clan code layer. Just a plain-text header:</color>\n\n<color=#DFDFDF>From: Star Colonel Arelle Jorgensson, Clan Ghost Bear Watch</color>\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>The feed activates immediately. Arelle’s face fills the screen—rigid posture, pale eyes gleaming like frost through glass. No formality. No restraint.\n\nOnly fury.</color>\n\n“I should have known better than to trust a pack of mercenary <i>surats</i>.\n\nYou have aligned yourself with <i>dezgra</i> filth—the refuse of a broken Clan. You carry their rot now. It stains your name, your crew, your vessel. You are nothing but scavengers pretending at honor.\n\nSo hear me clearly. You are now marked prey. I will drag your broken hull from wherevery you are hiding and leave it smoldering as a warning to every misguided fool who dares harbor the [[DM.Factions[faction_MinnesotaTribe],Minnesota Tribe]].\n\nThere will be no trial. No batchall. No surrender. Only judgment.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>The message ends in a hard cut, like a slammed door on a war council.\n\nDarius exhales slowly.</color> “Yeah. That sounds about right.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Sumire tilts her head at the comm screen.</color> “I was expecting more ice. That was lava.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Yang scoffs, shaking his head.</color> “Dezgra. Hah. That’s what they call traitors and criminals. She just lumped us in with the whole damn Tribe.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Darius narrows his eyes at the log buffer.</color> “This wasn’t a warning. It was a declaration. She’s unleashed the entire [[DM.Factions[faction_GhostBearWatch],Watch]] on us now.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>The bridge falls quiet.\n\nYou glance across your crew—still processing, still wary—but the decision was already made.</color>\n\n“Enough. Back to work. We knew this wouldn’t be clean.”",
