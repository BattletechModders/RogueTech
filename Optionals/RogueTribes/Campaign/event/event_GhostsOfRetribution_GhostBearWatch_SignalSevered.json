It’s a large Periphery world—dry as a bone with a thin, toxic atmosphere. Terrain’s mostly cracked basins, scorched plateaus, and the scattered remains of abandoned mining ops.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>She scrolls further, then adds,</color> “The population’s tiny. Practically everyone’s tied to a massive high-security prison complex along the equator. Outside of that, it’s just a few dusty mining enclaves and service shacks clinging to life.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Farah taps the screen again.</color> “Dust storms roll in constantly, and static interference makes off-world comms next to useless. The place isn’t just isolated—it’s cut off. All of that makes it perfect for covert movements or disappearing completely. And something tells me that’s exactly why the Tribe is here.”\n\n<b><color=#F79B25>[A new flashpoint has been created in the <i>Butzfleth</i> system, head there for the contract]</color></b>"
