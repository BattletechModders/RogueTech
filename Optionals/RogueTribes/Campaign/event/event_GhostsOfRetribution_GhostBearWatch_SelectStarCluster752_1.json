    "Details": "<color=#BFBFBF>The <i>Argo</i> settles into high orbit over a scorched, wind-blasted world in the <i>Star Cluster 752</i> system. Below lies <b>Merovi</b>—a desolate, sand-choked planet littered with decaying Star League ruins. Bunkers, towers, and broken relay stations half-consumed by time now serve a new master: the Minnesota Tribe. From these fractured strongholds, they coordinate raids and dig in.\n\nA Hyperpulse transmission arrives as the crew finishes system checks. Star Colonel Arelle Jorgensson appears at the holotable, her tone clipped and focused.</color>\n\n“Commander {COMMANDER.Callsign}. Welcome to <i>Star Cluster 752</i>. The Tribe has embedded itself in multiple positions across the surface. All must be eliminated.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>A tactical map lights up with three key targets.</color>\n\n“One is a combat staging zone—dug in and defended. No objectives but the enemy. You’ll make contact, break their line, and erase everything breathing.\n\nAnother is a buried [[DM.Factions[faction_SLDF],SLDF]] relay. They’ve been using it for long-range coordination—now they’re trying to wipe it before we reach it. You’ll recover the data and shut them down.\n\nThe third is a logistics redoubt. Not fully fortified yet, but once it is, they’ll use it to resupply and repair forward elements across the region. Take it before they do.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>She folds her arms.</color>\n\n“You will complete all three. This is not about choice—only sequence. You have <b>14</b> days to begin the one you select. After each, you’ll be rewarded—advanced tech, recovered gear, surplus resources.”\n\n“Choose your first strike, Commander.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>The transmission ends.</color>",
