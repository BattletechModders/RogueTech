The hulking war machine is gone. Against all odds, they won.\n\nSumire leans back in her chair, grinning.</color> “Still can't believe we dropped that walking mountain. Bet the whole damn planet felt it hit the ground.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Yang scoffs through a mouthful of food.</color> “I felt it in my spine. Thing must’ve weighed more than an assault carrier.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Even Farah allows herself a tired smile.</color> “And now… maybe this ends.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>But as the minutes tick by, the smiles begin to fade. No encrypted burst from Arelle. No update. No acknowledgment. Nothing.\n\nDarius glances around the table, frowning.</color> “She should’ve said something by now. Even a one-line message.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Farah checks her terminal again.</color> “No ping on her key. Nothing from the [[DM.Factions[faction_GhostBearWatch],Watch]] core either.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Yang mutters,</color> “Maybe she’s off the grid now that her job’s done. Pulled a vanishing act.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Sumire’s expression darkens.</color> “But the [[DM.Factions[faction_MinnesotaTribe],Tribe]]’s not done. They still hold systems. Why disappear now?”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Suddenly an incoming transmission flashes on the main wall.</color>\n\n<color=#DFDFDF>INCOMING: Ghost Bear Watch Command priority signal – Level Three Encryption Detected – No personal authorization key present.</color>\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Darius straightens instantly.</color> “That’s not right.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>The room stills.</color>",

Not good at all.</color>"
