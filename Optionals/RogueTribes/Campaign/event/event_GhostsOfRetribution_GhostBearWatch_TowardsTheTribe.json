The effort failed to produce sustainable results. Today, only a handful of pre-fabricated plasteel habitation blocks remain, connected by basic air-tunnels. Most of the infrastructure has been mothballed or scavenged.</color>\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Farah looks at you with worry.</color> “No one's updated this in over five years. And no one’s checked why.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Yang crosses his arms.</color> “Abandoned sites and bad ideas. Tribe sure knows how to pick ‘em.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>Sumire exhales sharply.</color> “Just once, I’d like a nice, breathable atmosphere. With snacks.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>With jump coordinates locked in, there’s nothing left to do but go.</color>",
