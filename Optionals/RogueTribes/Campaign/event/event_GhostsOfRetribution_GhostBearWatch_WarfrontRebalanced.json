    "Details": "<color=#BFBFBF>A new Hyperpulse message appears at the <i>Argo</i>’s comms console, flagged with Watch encryption and marked “<b>Priority Advisory – Strategic Update</b>”. Sumire intercepts it immediately, eyebrows raised.</color>\n\n“Message is from Arelle’s admin staff,” <color=#BFBFBF>she says, already decrypting.</color> “It’s… a theater-wide disposition report. Special bulletin.”\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>The contents unfold over the holotable in stark, structured detail.\n\n[[DM.Factions[faction_GhostBearWatch],Ghost Bear Watch]] forces have successfully completed operations in <i>Star Cluster 752</i>, <i>Horgens</i>, and <i>Outpost #11</i>. All three systems are now considered secure and under Watch authority, with transition efforts underway and tactical networks re-established.\n\nBut the report is more than just a victory log.\n\nAlongside the advances, it reveals that the [[DM.Factions[faction_MinnesotaTribe],Minnesota Tribe]] has simultaneously locked down a large amount of jump points across surrounding sectors—chokepoints, transit gates, even hidden routes once thought abandoned. These positions weren’t taken in response to the Watch's actions—they were part of a broader design, executed in parallel.\n\nThe Watch now classifies several adjacent systems as “<b>denied-access zones</b>,” effectively cutting off a growing arc of space from routine operations.\n\nSumire hits a quick succession of keys, with the computer replying with a series of beeps.</color> “Star map’s updated. All logged and verified.”\n\nDarius looks at you, with a slight frown. “So what's the plan now, Commander?”",
