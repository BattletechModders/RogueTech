    "Details": "<color=#BFBFBF>A low chime echoes through the <i>Argo</i>’s bridge—an automated intercept pushed to high priority. INN’s insignia swirls onto the display, followed by a jarring, blood-red headline across the feed:</color>\n\n<b><color=#B00000>“WHO’S NEXT? UNKNOWN FORCES STRIKE FROM THE DARK—NO WORLD SAFE”</color></b>\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>The anchor’s voice cuts through, cool and deliberate, framed by looping footage of devastation—shattered landing fields, burning settlements, fleeing civilians, and fragmented silhouettes of hulking ‘Mechs dissolving into mist.</color>\n\n<color=#DFDFDF>“Unidentified combat elements have launched simultaneous raids across dozens of systems—from Inner Sphere borders to the Deep Periphery. No pattern. No warning. Entire facilities wiped off the map before defenders even realized they were under attack. Local garrisons are left standing without a clue who to pursue—no survivors, no traces, just silence after these ghost forces hit.”</color>\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>A shaky holovid fills the screen: panicked colonists fleeing a collapsing dome, then a flash of light and a plume of rising dust.</color>\n\n<color=#DFDFDF>“Even more disturbing,” the anchor adds, “is the growing number of civilian disappearances reported in the aftermath of these attacks. In some cases, entire communities have gone missing. No bodies. No remains. Are they being enslaved? Bodysnatched? Authorities remain silent.”</color>\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>The broadcast cuts to a heavily filtered vid-call with a mustachioed man in a crisp Lyran uniform, his nameplate conveniently smudged. The feed caption reads: <b>Anonymous Lyran General</b>.</color>\n\n<color=#DFDFDF>“Frankly,” says the general, “this has the fingerprints of a new Clan invasion. We know some Clans never entered the Inner Sphere. I wouldn’t rule out another incursion.”</color>\n\n<color=#BFBFBF>The anchor returns, voice low and intense:</color>\n\n<color=#DFDFDF>“Or is it mercenary trickery to spark panic for profit? A rogue ComStar fleet, returned from long dormancy? Or something worse? One thing is certain—these ghosts of war are real, and no world, no colony, no family is beyond their reach. <b>YOU</b> could be next.”</color>",
