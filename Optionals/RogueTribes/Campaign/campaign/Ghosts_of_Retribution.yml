                  The “Ghosts of Retribution” campaign is now available. To begin, start the flashpoint in the star system of Maisons.

                  It will span a over a large number of contracts in several regions of the galaxy. The time investment is considerably longer than normal flashpoints, but the rewards are also much better.

                  The story has several branching points, consider your choices carefully before taking an option.

                  A contract will now spawn in the Command Center and it is not possible to leave the star system or take other contracts until it has been completed. It is however possible to do all other forms of actions in the system during the contract lock, including saving.

                  The campaign will utilize this type of contracts extensively, usually time gated. If they are not started before the time limit expires, they will trigger automatically. It is therefore recommended to prepare and take the contract before its deadline.

                  In this case the contract will automatically trigger in <b>7</b> days, if it is not started manually before that.

                  The campaign often uses breadcrumb flashpoints, they will have a <color=#FF00FF>magenta</color> color for the marker on the star map.

                  If a contract part of the campaign is failed, the campaign will temporarily pause until you feel ready to try again without any time limit.

                  In such a situation the campaign is resumed by a Flashpoint at the location of the failed contract.
