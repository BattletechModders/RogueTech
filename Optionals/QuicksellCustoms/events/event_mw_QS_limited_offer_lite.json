It looks kind of dodgy, but, well... See for yourself \" \r\n\r\nYou take a look at the message, which reads: \"Dear Sir/Madam, are you in the market for a reliable used mech, but don't have time to come and put it through it's paces? Let me tell you about this gem that fell off the back of a dropship. It's a later model Quicsell mech of high tonnage and low mileage, and I can assure you it's in excellent condition. It's a steal at the price I'm offering, and it won't be available for long. I can even have it delivered right to your dropship, and will include some extra spare parts and assorted Quicsell merchandise free of charge. So what do you say, are you ready to start tuning your new ride?\" \r\n\r\nYou turn a skeptical eye towards Darius, trying to convey your thoughts, but he continues on. \"Look, I know, alright? But I ran the numbers, and if there really is a mech in there, we'll nearly break even just by selling the thing if we don't like the look of it. I figured I'd bring it to your attention at least.\"",
