This is nothing short of a scam.\" \n\n  He clenches his fists, the anger evident. \"I should've known better. We've been had. The only thing they delivered on was disappointment. I'll be in the Mech Bay, figuring out what we can salvage from this sorry excuse of a deal. \n\n Later, a communication from Quicsell arrives, claiming it was an 'error' , and as a 'good faith' gesture, they've issued a refund, giving you back half your hard-earned C-Bills.
