He points at the mech, tapping the structure with his wrench, the sound echoing a hint of hollowness. \"Commander... they drilled <i>Holes...</i> Holes!\" he exclaims, frustration evident. \n\n \"Sure, it's endosteel or something, but who saves weight by weakening the structure?\" \n\n With a heavy sigh, he fixes you with a serious look. \"If you decide not to scrap this mech, Commander, I'd tread cautiously. Thin armor, and we might just find ourselves in need of a new Khan for our little 'clan,' Commander.\""
