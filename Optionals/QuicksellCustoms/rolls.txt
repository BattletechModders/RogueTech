Vapor Eagle Flashpoint
    So my pitch for the vapor eagle is kinda this, It'd be a flaspoint where your get challenged to a duel on a gameworld so they can show off some custom experimental mech they 'aqquired' 
    from clan steel fox in a duel of thier own, what you dont know is it wasnt a duel at all they infact stole it after a solaris match, some sort of popular clansmen showing off clan superiority, 
    during your duel he shows up in another mech telling you to get out of the way, of course you cant cause its a duel, he fights you both if you win the mission you get a loot box with a chance 
    to get the mech intact or as salvage along with some QS gear(can the game detect how many pieces your set to?) or a random steel viper mech/ gear , mission would be no salvage
    i know im mostly correct on clan honor and what they think of inner sphere surats and freebirths
    Or perhaps you fight a star of steel viper mechs in a contract prior to the Duel
