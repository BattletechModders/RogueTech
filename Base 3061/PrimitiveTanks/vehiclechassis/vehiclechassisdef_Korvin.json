    "Details": "The Korvin Tank was built in the early 2300s around the Large Laser, which had recently been developed by the Terran Hegemony and copied by the Capellan Confederation. The penetrating power of the energy weapon was second to none at the time and it gave the Korvin a powerful edge as most combat vehicles were ill-prepared for it. The Korvin did not age well. As armor became better and a single blast from its signature weapon was no longer enough to penetrate to the internal structure, the Korvin was not as successful, so it was relegated to garrison duty. Wu Industries attempted to bring it back with a new model in 2430. The average design was not able to save the company, which failed in 2612.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 5/8 Hex: 150/240 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<b>Armor:</b> Armor\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       210     25\n<b>Left</b>         130     25\n<b>Right</b>       130     25\n<b>Rear</b>         85     25\n<b>Turret</b>      105     25\n\n<b>Total</b>      660    125\n",
