    "Details": "In 3050 the Duchy of Vendôme's military realized a need for a new main battle tank. Engineers on Brekke took a shortcut and reverse engineered the legendary Estevez from surviving examples. A modern fuel cell engine allowed the gun to be replaced with a versatile Thumper, and a 10 tube SRM array for close combat. Basic but modern armor and fire control upgrades complete a simple but serviceable tank. Importantly one that could be manufactured with tech centuries behind the cutting edge. Named after a militia officer on New Avalon where it was built, the Estevez was the main battle tank of the Federated Suns throughout the twenty-fourth century and into the Age of War. It entered service by 2310 as one of the earliest and most effective tank designs developed outside the Terran Hegemony. With its sheer size and power the Estevez often caused lighter armed enemies to break and run, thus developing a fearsome reputation over decades of service. By the early 2400s, however, advancing technology had made the Estevez obsolete. Its main gun proved ineffective against more modern armor, made worse by its now-outdated fire control system and inability to fire specialized munitions. Its large crew and high fuel consumption also drained Armed Forces of the Federated Suns resources in prolonged conflicts. The Estevez was eventually taken out of front line service in the mid-25th century after a disastrous simulated battle against Draconis Combine BattleMechs on Robinson. However once in a while an Estevez liberated from a museum appears in irregular forces to this day.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Fuel Cell: Improved vehicle engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 4/6 Hex: 120/180 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Armor\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       205     40\n<b>Left</b>         151     40\n<b>Right</b>       151     40\n<b>Rear</b>        140     40\n<b>Turret</b>      185     40\n\n<b>Total</b>      832    200\n</color>",
