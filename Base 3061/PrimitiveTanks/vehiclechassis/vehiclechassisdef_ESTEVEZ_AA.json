    "Details": "A 2360 conversion into a second-line garrison tank, the anti-air variant replaced the old turret armament with two Autocannon/2s with three tons of ammo and one machine gun while leaving everything else unchanged. Named after a militia officer on New Avalon where it was built, the Estevez was the main battle tank of the Federated Suns throughout the twenty-fourth century and into the Age of War. It entered service by 2310 as one of the earliest and most effective tank designs developed outside the Terran Hegemony. With its sheer size and power the Estevez often caused lighter armed enemies to break and run, thus developing a fearsome reputation over decades of service. By the early 2400s, however, advancing technology had made the Estevez obsolete. Its main gun proved ineffective against more modern armor, made worse by its now-outdated fire control system and inability to fire specialized munitions. Its large crew and high fuel consumption also drained Armed Forces of the Federated Suns resources in prolonged conflicts. The Estevez was eventually taken out of front line service in the mid-25th century after a disastrous simulated battle against Draconis Combine BattleMechs on Robinson. However once in a while an Estevez liberated from a museum appears in irregular forces to this day.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>ICE: Air breathing Combustion Engine.
