    "Details": "Developed by the New Earth Trading Company in 2587, the Alacorn attracted a reputation in the SLDF as an effective and dependable tank. The Mk II Alacorn was another design prototype introduced alongside with the Mk I. Though it used the same engine and chassis as the Mk I, the Mk II carried three AC/20s in its turret. It only carried three tons of ammunition however, and to make room for the heavier guns the armor protection was reduced to six tons. This resulted in a vehicle with a much shorter effective range, meaning it had to close with enemy forces, but the machine lacked the armor to survive a close-up fight.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Tracked: High traction, agile turning.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 3/5 Hex: 90/150 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<b>Armor:</b> Armor\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       140     50\n<b>Left</b>         105     50\n<b>Right</b>       105     50\n<b>Rear</b>         80     50\n<b>Turret</b>      114     50\n\n<b>Total</b>      544    250\n",

  "YangsThoughts": "Boss, Alacorns are one of the few tanks you will ever hear me say can reasonably stand toe to toe with a 'Mech. Their armor is incredibly thick and they are reasonably armed, a wise MechWarrior would stay weary of them.",
