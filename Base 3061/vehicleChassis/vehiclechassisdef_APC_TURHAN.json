    "Details": "The Turhan was first built for the Terran Hegemony in 2530 by Dieron's Buhallin Military Products. The company, known for its wheeled vehicles, built the Turhan to answer the HAF's need for an urban assault vehicle to support its infantry in urban environments. The vehicle acted as an Armored Personnel Carrier, deploying troops from its large infantry transport bay. The vehicle is protected by seven and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor, which ensured its cargo arrived at the designation intact. The Turhan's principal weaponry was its twin Large Lasers which were mounted in its turret. Mounted with the lasers were a pair of Machine Guns.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Wheeled: Fast in open ground, slow in rough terrain.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 4/6 Hex: 120/180 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<b>Armor:</b> Ferro-Fibrous\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       172     25\n<b>Left</b>         147     25\n<b>Right</b>       147     25\n<b>Rear</b>        130     25\n<b>Turret</b>      110     25\n\n<b>Total</b>      706    125\n",
