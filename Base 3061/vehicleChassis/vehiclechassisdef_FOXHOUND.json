    "Name": "Foxhound Self Proelled Gun",
    "Details": "An unusual Cappellan tank, the Foxhound is actually a Davion design that was just entering the prototype stage when Operation Guerrero kicked off. The Cappellans overran the Sarna March research facility where the prototype was undergoing field testing and the design was quickly pressed into service. Named the Foxhound to spite the Davion leadership, the tank is built around a 240 rated fusion engine and is designed as an inexpensive platform for carrying a Sniper Artillery piece. Alongside the Sniper, the Foxhound carries 2 SRM-6’s and 3 SRM-4’s, allowing it to defend itself should enemies close in. 5 tons of Sniper ammo and 2 tons of SRM ammo are carried in CASE protected magazines.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Tracked: High traction, agile turning.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 3/5 Hex: 90/120 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<b>Armor:</b> Ferro-Fibrous\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       235     40\n<b>Left</b>         135     40\n<b>Right</b>       135     40\n<b>Rear</b>        100     40\n<b>Turret</b>      200     40\n\n<b>Total</b>      805    200\n",
