    "Details": "Created for the SLDF Royal units, this version uses a 280XL engine to increase its maximum speed to 86 km/h. Three Streak SRM-2 launchers replace the standard SRM-6 and it carries Medium Pulse Lasers in place of the standard versions. To increase protection, the turret gains a half ton of armor. The Demon was originally created by the SLDF as its standard fighting vehicle in 2716. A match for any light or medium BattleMech, the Demon had good maneuverability and was protected by ten tons of slab armor, most of it concentrated in its front. Due to the nature of its powerful main weapon the Demon was often used in ambush attacks and fought in pairs instead of the usual four-vehicle lance. The vehicle's main disadvantage was its lack of speed, which made it vulnerable to faster 'Mechs and other vehicles able to maneuver around and engage its weaker rear armor.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 5/8 Hex: 150/240 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Armor\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       250     30\n<b>Left</b>         170     30\n<b>Right</b>       170     30\n<b>Rear</b>        100     30\n<b>Turret</b>      150     30\n\n<b>Total</b>      840    150\n</color>",
