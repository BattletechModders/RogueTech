    "Details": "Developed by the New Earth Trading Company in 2587, the Alacorn attracted a reputation in the SLDF as an effective and dependable tank. Another prototype developed shortly after the Mk III in 2588, this variant was essentially an upgrade of the Mk. II to alleviate its armor problems. It was still outfitted with the ultimate big-gun of its era: a trio of AC/20s. Despite addressing some of the concerns of the Mk. II, it saw a limited production run.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 3/5 Hex: 90/150 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<b>Armor:</b> Armor\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       250     50\n<b>Left</b>         197     50\n<b>Right</b>       197     50\n<b>Rear</b>        130     50\n<b>Turret</b>      250     50\n\n<b>Total</b>      1024    250\n",
