    "Details": "The Blizzard Hover Transport was designed by Kressly Warworks and was first produced in 3054. While the Blizzard was intended for use against the Clans, it gained notoriety in the Chaos March and its effectiveness was realized in the Capellan-St. Ives War. The only weaponry integral to the Blizzard is a turret-mounted LongFire V LRM-5. This enables the speedy vehicle to remain out of range for most weapons, yet still contribute to the fight once its infantry bays are debarked. It can even hide behind cover and rely on infantry units to spot so it can fire indirectly.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Hover: Fast on open ground and water, slow in rough terrain, not very agile.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>ICE: Air breathing Combustion Engine.
