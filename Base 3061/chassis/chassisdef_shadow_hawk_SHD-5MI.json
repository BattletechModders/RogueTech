Unfortunately the design was deemed to expensive too produce and as a result the military declined to purchase any of the initial production run. Such poor performance led to the second manufacturing run being cancelled and resources diverted to more promising lines. The surviving models were sold off to various mercenary groups, though the Maverick Industries scion would use one during her time in the 10th Lyran Guards; netting the company the occasional conversion or custom order from fellow members of the regiment. \n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Battle Fists</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.05</color></b>",
