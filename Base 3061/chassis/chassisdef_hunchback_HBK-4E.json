The design spread to other interested parties, after the Corps relaxed their licensing arrangements, following the Scarlet Fist debacle; in which the a lone Corps pilot – Larissa ‘‘Raza’’ Brooks – managed to successfully evaded the pirate band responsible for the destruction of her lance, before stalking them back to their base and levelling it with repeated Thumper volleys in the middle of the night.",
