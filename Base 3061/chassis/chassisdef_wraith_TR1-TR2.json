    "Details": "The Wraith marked Curtiss Militech's entry into BattleMech production. When the design was announced, many felt that the design would be little more than a walking water cooler. What the critics got was a shock. The Wraith is a 'Mech that, when properly employed, can wreak havoc on an enemy with its astounding speed and maneuverability. It is built around a massive LTV 385 XL Engine that allows it to reach speeds of just under 119 kph. The Wraith has a simple, yet effective, pulse weapons payload. Pulse laser weaponry allows the Mech to negate most of the side effects on accuracy that are introduced by the Wraith's heavy use of jump jets, making it incredibly accurate and powerful for such a lightly armed Mech. A simple modification of the Wraith, the TR2 simply replaces the Large Pulse Laser with an ER PPC, turning the 'Mech into a highly capable sniper.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Ubiquitous</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.05</color></b>",
