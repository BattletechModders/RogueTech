The standard engine on the 'Mech was replaced with a Nissan 275 XLversion and the armor has been upgraded to Kallon Unity Weave Ferro-Fibrous material with an extra half-ton added. To increase the Wolverine's speed, MASC has been added, allowing it to move up to 108 km/h in bursts. Finally, the weapons payload has been upgraded as well. The autocannon has been upgraded to a General Motors Nova-5 Ultra Autocannon/5 and the medium laser is now a Sutel Precision Line Medium Pulse Laser. The design retains its jumping capability, as well as the SRM-6, although CASE now protects the SRM reloads\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Improved Communications</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.05</color></b>",
