    "Details": "The 10D variant of the Bombardier is a refit performed by Earthwerks Incorporated during the Succession Wars as many advanced components became lostech; while Wakazashi were content not to manufacture any more Bombardiers, the company was prepared to license Earthwerks to produce parts for existing 'Mechs, resulting in the 10D refit. While the Delphinius and Arrowlight launchers were swapped out for low-tech Doombud and Hovertech models, the AMS system was completely replaced with a Machine Gun. Perhaps the biggest difference was the replacement of VOX 325 XL engine with the smaller Magna 260, giving the design a top speed of 64.8km/h and cruising speed of 43km/h. In addition, the CASE that protected the vulnerable ammunition stores has been removed from the design, while the armor protection itself has not changed. As a part of the refit performed by Earthwerks in their Calloway VI plant the communications system was replaced with the Neil 5000 system and the targeting and tracking system was replaced with the RCA Instatrac Mark XII system.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Stable</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.07</color></b>",
