Among the designs pushed into production was the 69K, redesigned to use modern technologies from across the Inner Sphere.

Produced at Irian technologies Shiro III facility until the early 3060’s, the mech was sold at cost to buyers; with the FWL subsidising production as part of their contributions to the war. \n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Easy to Pilot</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 0.98</color></b>",
