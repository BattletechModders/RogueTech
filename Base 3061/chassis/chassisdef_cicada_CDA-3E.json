Conceived as a relatively cheap support mech, with the speed to keep up with lighter scout elements and enough ammunition to last most engagements, it has maintained steady sales since it’s introduction and convinced Gibson to refit one of their older 2A production lines; to produce this variant. Deployed by everyone from the FWL to the Outworlds Alliance, this mech has been spreading across the IS and is a common sight among defensive garrisons. Critics of the design note it’s lack of armour and CASE whilst proponents praise it’s low cost and tactical flexibility. <b><color=#53ff1a>Restricted Actuators- Left: Upper, Right: Upper</color></b>",
