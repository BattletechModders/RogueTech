    "Details": "During the Amaris Civil War, several Lyran MechWarriors joined the SLDF in defiance of their government's policy of neutrality. With this came the coup that the Star League Defense Force had attempted to pull off for decades: the acquisition of the Lyran Commando. Long considered one of the better scout 'Mechs in the Inner Sphere, at least one of these Commandos accompanied Kerensky into exile and several of them appeared in the forces assigned to Operation Klondike. As newer weapons and 'Mechs made their way into the Clan arsenal, these Commandos began to show their age, so Clan Goliath Scorpion began a program to upgrade theirs. Dubbed the Commando IIC, this upgrade used newer technologies to outperform its venerable cousin. With the proliferation of OmniMechs, most Commando IICs were relegated to second line status, though the Scorpions still continue to outfit some of their pirate hunters with these 'Mechs.",
