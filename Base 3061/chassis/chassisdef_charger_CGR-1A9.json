All of the smaller lasers (except for the head mounted one) were replaced with medium lasers and a single LRM-20 launcher was mounted in the right torso, with two tons of reloads carried in the left torso. To make up for the lost mobility, four jump jets were also installed, two in each leg, to allow the Charger to jump up to one hundred and twenty meters. This variant was fielded in time to surprise the Armed Forces of the Federated Suns during the War of 3039, but in years since the design fell into the hands of the Outworlds Alliance thanks to a legal snafu which gave Ravenna Electronics a production license.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Barrel Fist</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.12</color></b>",
