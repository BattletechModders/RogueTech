A cheap upgrade, this is a favourite of pilots who were previously assigned a 68; with many praising the enhanced range and accuracy of the Laser. Paired into demi lances, and assigned a C3 Master equipped mech to coordinate, these Mongoose's are deployed as head hunters and long range harassers; both roles that make use of their high ground speed and manoeuvrability. Fast and deadly, they have already made a name for themselves, with one Mongoose formation accounting for 5 kills, including a Star Colonel in a Timberwolf during the Great Refusal. \n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Easy to Pilot</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 0.98</color></b>",
