    "Details": "The Ostscout was designed as a pure recon BattleMech by Ostmann Industries. To that end, it was built entirely around gathering data and getting out of trouble, tasks for which it is exceptional. The Ostscout is quick enough to escape most traps, and very few other designs can match it in terms of speed and maneuverability. However its ability to run and leap out of danger came at the expense of offensive capability. In fact were it not for aggressive lobbying on the part of its test pilots the final production model would have been completely weaponless. As it is, the Ostcout would be hard-pressed to win a fight against all but the lightest 'Mechs. A poor combatant, the 'Mech excels at operating deep behind enemy lines, gathering as much information as possible about the terrain and the disposition of enemy forces. Besides the Great Houses, ComStar also utilized the Ostscout, and in the aftermath of the Clan Invasion and ComStar Schism began developing a new Ostscout variant for their Com Guards. This new model would maintain the same maneuverability and intelligence-gathering capabilities of the original while improving its offensive and defensive capabilities. Debuting with success in 3064, within the next three years nearly half of all Com Guard Ostscouts had been upgraded to the new variant; however it was soon discovered that both the Lyran Alliance and Word of Blake were fielding their own updated Ostscouts identical to ComStar's. The intelligence leak would be confirmed and traced back to Dag Kesselring, former Precentor of the 66th Division, who passed on information about the program to both the Lyrans and Blakists. <b><color=#53ff1a>Restricted Actuators- Left: Lower, Right: Lower</color></b>",

  "YangsThoughts": "The Ostscout carries a single Tronel II Medium Laser mounted in its center torso. This weapon, while not extremely powerful, is enough to dissuade most light scout assets from attempting to pursue. The ten heat sinks the 'Mech carries is more than enough to handle the heat output of this single laser - indeed the Ostscout can jump 210 meters and fire laser at the same time without overheating at all. While it is protected by four and a half tons of armor, the real protection for the 'Mech is its speed and maneuverability. A massive sixteen-ton fusion engine more commonly seen in 'Mechs twice its size propels the Ostscout to a cruising speed of 86.4 km/h. Eight jump jets built into the left and right legs give it a maximum jumping distance of 240 meters, rivaling that of the Spider. <b><color=#53ff1a>Restricted Actuators- Left: Lower, Right: Lower</color></b>",
