With production lines on Keystone and Oliver this variant sought to enhance the original's long-range capabilities. The engine was exchanged for a Hermes 275 extralight model and carried fourteen double heat sinks to improve heat management. The normal PPC was replaced by a Fusigon Longtooth ER PPC, for longer reach at the expense of more heat, and the LRM launcher had been upgraded to a Doombud LRM-20 launcher, for more indirect fire support capabilities. Finally a ChrisComp Small Laser was mounted in the head and the two tons of LRM reloads in the left torso were protected by CASE. While intended for the Free Worlds League Military the capture of Oliver by FedCom forces meant the 3M also appeared in large numbers in the Armed Forces of the Federated Commonwealth.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Battle Fists</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.05</color></b>",
