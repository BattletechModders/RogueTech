Roguetanks
By Cargo Vroom

The vehicles of Roguetech. Originally based on Vehicle Improvement Project, now grown out of all proportion.

Some units by, based on work by, or maintained by LadyAlecto, Justin Kase and Raza5, and the RT Team in general

RogueTanks Modules:

Base 3061/vehicle - The Majority of RT's vehicles, things available widely in the IS and Periphery.
Base 3061/PrimitiveTanks - Units mostly armed with Rifles, RL, MG, and some basic 3025 weapons, mostly powered by ICE or Fuel Cell. 
                            Only the most ragtag of interstellar powers use these, they're often found in the hands of local militia and cash strapped mercs.
Base 3061/CLANK - Clan tanks with clan gear.
Base 3061/VTOL - Air units, mostly by LadyAlecto
PirateTech/vehicle - Units armed with the odd pirate weapons cobbled together by people who probably shout "Witness Me!" when entering combat.
Superheavys/vehicle - Tanks over 100 tons, mostly for use in special endgame missions.
Misc Era and DLC subfolders - Most of these have a catch all vehicle folder for IS, clan, and vtol units.

Custom Tags List:

unit_hover,
unit_noconvoy, Things that are too fast, or too slow, to be appropriate and fun in convoys
unit_primitive,
unit_carrier, glass cannon vehicles, most of them are armed with lots of missiles
unit_stealth, any vehicle with stealth armor
unit_predator, Things with boosted sensor, tagging gear and active probes
unit_vbied, Things with suicide bombs

Units with a great many variants are tagged in case we want to deal with them.

unit_galleon,
unit_behemoth,
unit_harasser,
unit_ontos,
unit_scimitar,
unit_brutus,
unit_pegasus,
unit_zephyr,
unit_hunter,
unit_demolisher <- Literally every faction has these

Changelog:

Carrier Update Project:

Many carriers have illegal loadouts for whatever reason. 
(Straight up basic stat errors, small errors creeping in in successive updates and tweaks,
Changes in the way I calculate the weight of FCS and sensor gear.)

2.2.1

Added SRM Carrier (ECM)
Removed "unit_tracked" and "unit_wheels" tags from all hover units.

Made a "unit_noconvoy" tag; applied it to the swiftwind; added it to exclusion list of OpForConvoy lances.

2.1.7
 
Gave slightly better loot to a bunch of vehicles even if it was just a non-stock MG.
Gave serious gear to a couple, like the now very accurate Pike and the 'elite' Manticore_dupe
    I think it improves player experience, their reaction to seeing a plus weapon on a tank, 
    even if it's actually just a +Crit Mlaser, is a mix of worry and greed that overcomes any disapointment 
    that the vehicle isn't a pinata they can beat for mech parts.


Installed MG arrays in several vehicles that had 4 or more MG's.
Fixed two Brutus tanks sharing a def,
Fixed Pegasus_RT move speed,

2.0.0

Complete restructruing. VIP merged with RogueTank. This is now RoguetankXL, the majority of units, and almost all the ones that don't have an individual ingame chassis go here. Roguetank Core contains APCS, variations on vanilla vehicles, and a few carefully selected others.

Corrected armor of Alcorn.
Corrected armor on Demolisher II.
Found Demolisher-R, Shepard, Rottweiler, Kingscorpion to be underweight by TT rules. Corrected trying not to change the spirit of the designs.
Gorgon wasn't TT legal without some involved changes. Found that XL engine allowed something very close to original, it's a medium now.
Harrasser-B overweight. Loadout nerfed to two SSRM4.
Rebuilt Merkava IV and rechristened it "Chariot" because of lore naming conflict and it being to heavy to run with an ICE.
