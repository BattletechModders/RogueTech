        "Details" : "It has long been known that angular momentum (and thus stabilizing effects) can be increased in a gyrostabilizer by spinning the same mass faster; however, such gyroscopes would release all it's stored kinetic energy upon structural failure (i.e. penetrations from incoming weapons fire) in a catastrophic detonation, and performance gains were relatively small. Using an undisclosed source of graphene-flake reinforced materials, Toho Heavy Industries has been able to construct High-Energy Gyros that are spun to supersonic speeds, and thus are significantly smaller and lighter. Due to the danger they are disfavored by pilots of lightly armored units, whom derisively call these Gyros 'High Explosive'.",
