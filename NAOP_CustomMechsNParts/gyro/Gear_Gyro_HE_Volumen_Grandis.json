Using an undisclosed source of graphene-flake reinforced materials, Toho Heavy Industries has been able to construct High-Energy Gyros that are spun to supersonic speeds, and thus are significantly smaller and lighter. Due to the danger they are disfavored by pilots of lightly armored units, whom derisively call these Gyros 'High Explosive'.",
