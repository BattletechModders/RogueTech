  "Streak": true/false - if true only success hits will be shown, ammo decremental and heat generation will be based on success hits. 
							with "HitGenerator" : "Streak" - will be true streak effect all-hit-or-no-fire
  "HitGenerator" : "Streak", Set to hit generator. Supported values ("Individual"/"Cluster"/"Streak"). 
                                  Streak hit generator is sort of cluster, 
								  if first projectile hit, rest hit too (location distribution as cluster hit generator),
								  if first projectile misses, rest misses too
								  if not set weapon hit generator will be used.
								  if not set hit generator will be choosed by weapon type.
								  if weapon define has tag "wr-clustered_shots", "Cluster" hit generator will be forced. 
  "DirectFireModifier" : -10.0, Accuracy modifier if weapon can strike directly
  "DamageOnJamming": true/false, - if true on jamm weapon will be damaged
  "FlatJammingChance": 1.0, - Chance of jamming weapon after fire. 1.0 is jamm always. Unjamming logic implemented as in WeaponRealizer
  "GunneryJammingBase": 5, - 
  "GunneryJammingMult": 0.05, - this values uses to alter flat jamming chance by pilot skills 
                                  formula effective jamming chance = FlatJammingChance + (GunneryJammingBase - Pilot Gunnery)* GunneryJammingMult
								  if FlatJammingChance = 1.0, GunneryJammingBase = 6, GunneryJammingMult = 0.1, GunnerySkill = 10
								  result = 1.0 + (6-10)*0.1 = 0.6
								  GunneryJammingBase if ommited in weapon def., ammo def. and mode def. assumed as 5. 
  "DisableClustering": true/false - if true ProjectilesPerShot > 1 will affect only visual nor damage. If omitted consider as true.
  "NotUseInMelee": true, - if true even AntiPersonel weapon type will not fire on melee attack, AI aware. 
  "AlternateDamageCalc": false, - if true alternate damage calc formula will be implemented 
                              DamagePerShot = (damage from weaponDef + (damage from ammo) + (damage from mode)*(damage multiplayer from ammo)*(damage multiplayer from mode)*(damage with effects)/(damage from weaponDef)
  "AlternateHeatDamageCalc": false, - same as  AlternateDamageCalc but for heat 
  "AMSHitChance": 0.0, - if this weapon is AMS, this value is AMS efficiency, 
                         if this weapon is missile launcher this value shows how difficult to intercept missile with AMS. Negative value - is harder, 
						 positive is easer.
  "IsAMS": false, - if true this weapon acts as AMS. It will not fire during normal attack. But tries to intercept incomming missiles.
                    rude model: every 10 meters of missile fly path there is check, if it in range of any AMS. 
					If so, AMS have AMS.AMSHitChance + missile.AMSHitChance chance to shoot missile down. Avaible shoots count of AMS is decrementing.
					If AMS have no shoots avaible it will not shoot. At end of turn AMS shoots count set to AMS.ShootsWhenFired.
					If missile intercepted, no further checks will be made. 
					Commentary: as you can see, if missile fly path is short chance to be shooted down is less. 
					If missiles is few, and fly path is long chance to be shooted down grows rapidly. 
					AMS can become jammed, have damage-on-jam option and so on. AMSHitChance and ShootsWhenFired can be updated in AMS ammo or mode.
					AMS uses ammunition and heated while firing. Damage and on hit status effects will on be applied. 
  "IsAAMS": false - if true, weapon acts as advanced AMS, it will fire all missiles from enemies in range, not only attacking.
						NOTE! AMS can be setted by mode, ammo and weapon. Mode have priority, than ammo, and then weapon. 
						NOTE! If you weapon shoots as AMS in current round you can't use it in offensive mode (if any) until next round.
							  On other hand if you fired weapon this round you will not be able to use this weapon as AMS until next activation completes 
						NOTE! Every weapon effect can be used as visuals for AMS fire (missile, machine gun, ballistic, laser, gauss) you can experiment,
						      but some effects is more suitable.
  "AMSShootsEveryAttack": false, - if true AMS will not share AMS.ShootsWhenFired between all missile attacks this round. 
                                       Every missile attack will cause AMS.ShootsWhenFired shoots. 
								   if false AMS will shoot AMS.ShootsWhenFired per round
  "AMSImmune": false - if true, weapon missiles is immune to AMS and none AMS will try to intercept them.
  "AOECapable" : false, - if true weapon will included in AOE damage calculations. If true set in weapon definition 
                            all shoots will have AoE effect (even for energy weapon). If true, it can't be overridden by ammo.
  "AOERange": 100, - Area of effect range. If AOECapable in weapon is set to true this value will be used. If AOECapable is true, it can't be overridden by ammo.
  "AOEDamage": 0 - if > 0 alternative AoE damage algorithm will be used. Main projectile will not always miss. Instead it will inflict damage twice 
                            one for main target - direct hit (this damage can be have variance) and second for all targets in AoE range including main. 
  "AOEHeatDamage": 0 - if > 0 alternative AoE damage algorithm will be used. Main projectile will not always miss. Instead it will inflict damage twice 
                            one for main target - direct hit (this damage can be have variance) and second for all targets in AoE range including main. 
  "AOEInstability": 0 - instability AoE damage 
  "SpreadRange": 0, - Area of projectiles spread effect. If > 0 projectiles will include in spread calculations. Per weapon, ammo, mode values are additive.
                         if used for missiles, and target have AMS it will fire no matter if it is not advanced and target is not primary.
  "IFFDef" : "IFFComponentDefId", if not empty and target have component with such defId it will exclude form AoE and spread targets list. 
                                   if not empty weapon owner will be excluded form AoE and spread targets list anyway even it has no suitable IFF component.
								   supposed weapon have IFF transponder for own projectiles. If not empty ammo transponder has priority, than mode, and than weapon
								   There is special transponder name "_IFFOffile" - if transponder defId set as IFFOffline it counts as have no transponder at all.
  "HasShells": true/false, if defined determinate has shots shrapnel effect or not. If defined can't be overriden by ammo or mode. 
                            Shells count is effective ProjectilesPerShot for this weapon/ammo/mode.
                            Damage per shell - full damage per projectile / ProjectilesPerShot
                            Only for missiles, ballistic and gauss effects. Should not be used with AoE.
							NOTE! If ImprovedBallistic is false HasShells considered as false too no matter real value. 
  "ShellsRadius": 90, determines if shells will have spreading. Works same way as SpreadRange. Per weapon value will be used if HasShells is true for this weapon.
  "MinShellsDistance": 30, Minimum distance missile have to fly before explode. Min value 30.
  "MaxShellsDistance": 100, Distance from end of trajectory where missile should separate. Min value 20
                             Note: example - trajectory length 200, min 80, max 100 - missile will separate 100m from end.
							       example 2 trajectory length 100, min 80, max 100 - missile will separate 20m from end cause it have to fly 80m until separation. 
								   example 3 trajectory length 100 min 120, max 200 - missile will not separate at all. 
  "Unguided": false, for missiles effect only. If true missile trajectory will be strait line instead of curvy. Like it is unguided as old WW2 rockets. 
					True value tied IndirectCapablea and AlwaysIndirectVisuals to false. 
					logic: if ammo unguided is true - launch will be unguided no matter mode and weapon settings, 
					if ammo unguided is false or not set i'm looking at mode. if mode unguided is true launch will be unguided, 
					if mode unguided is false or not set i'm looking at weapon. 
					if weapon unguided is true launch will be unguided if not set or false launch will be guided
  "FireTerrainChance":1, - chance to fireup hex cell. Additive for weapon, ammo and mode
  "FireDurationWithoutForest":1, - duration of fire if hex cell has no forest, if > 0 even hex cell with no forest will burn. 
                                  If cell have forest burn period is max from FireDurationWithoutForest and BurningForestTurns
								  additive for weapon mode and ammo.
  "FireTerrainStrength":0, - strength of fire. If 0 and hex cell have no forest cell will not fire. If > 0 and hex cell have forest strength is max from FireTerrainStrength and BurningForestStrength
                                  additive for weapon mode and ammo.
  "FireOnSuccessHit" : true, - if true roll to fire hex cell will be permitted even on success hit. In that case fire hex cell will be detected as current target position. 
                               if false only projectiles that hits ground have chance to fire terrain. If ommited in weapon ammo and mode supposed as false.
							   mode value have priority, than ammo and than weapon.
					NOTES: expanding logic each turn each burning cell (no matter having forest or not) have BurningForestBaseExpandChance to expand no neighbour cell with forest 
					       burning cell not counted as forest.
						   If mech or vehicle ending move in burning cell they suffer heat damage. For mech it is heat damage, for vehicle it is normal damage splitted by all locations except turret.
						   Damage inflicted to vehicle that way are not cause critical damage to internal components only armor and structure.
						   Fired cell not saved on battle save/reload.
   "FireTerrainCellRadius":6, - radius in in-game cells to fire check roll. On impact each hex cell containing at least one map cell with in radius will have chance to be burned
                                additive for weapon mode and ammo.
   "AdditionalImpactVFX":"WFX_Nuke", - additional VFX played on impact. Mode have priority, than ammo, than weapon. Long played effects not supposed. 
                                       Effect game object will be cleaned and returned to pool on next fire sequence of this weapon. 
   "AdditionalImpactVFXScaleX":10, - scale of additional VFX, used only when AdditionalImpactVFX is not empty. Note, not all VFXs supports scaling.
   "AdditionalImpactVFXScaleY":10,

                                Clearing on success hit controled by FireOnSuccessHit flag.
   "Cooldown": 2, - number of rounds weapon will be unacceptable after fire this mode
   "ImprovedBallistic": true, - whether use or not own ballistic weapon effect engine. 
								Difference between "improved" and vanilla engine:
								1. Improved mode uses ShotsWhenFire properly (vanilla had not used them at all)
								2. Improved mode can use curvy trajectory for indirect fire (indirect gauss bullet can be used too, but looks very funny)
								3. Improved mode fire ShotsWhenFire volleys with ProjectilesPerShot bullets in each. 
								   Bullets in one volley fired simultaneously instead of one by one (as in WeaponRealizer)
								   But damage still dealt once per volley, not per bullet, to keep compatibility with vanilla.
								NOTE! If ImprovedBallistic is set DisableClustering is forced to true and "wr-clustered_shots" tag removed from definition. 
  "BallisticDamagePerPallet": true - if true damage inflicted per pallet instead of per shot. Only working with ImprovedBallistic true, ballistic weapon effect and HasShels false
                                     Damage will be divided by ProjectilesPerShot value, heat damage and stable damage too.

									   supposed weapon have IFF transponder for own projectiles. If not empty ammo transponder has priority, than mode, and than weapon
									   There is special transponder name "_IFFOffile" - if transponder defId set as IFFOffline it counts as have no transponder at all.
	  "HasShells": true/false, if defined determinate has shots shrapnel effect or not. If defined can't be overriden by ammo or mode. 
								Shells count is effective ProjectilesPerShot for this weapon/ammo/mode.
								Damage per shell - full damage per projectile / ProjectilesPerShot
								Only for missiles, ballistic and gauss effects. Should not be used with AoE.
								NOTE! If ImprovedBallistic is false HasShells considered as false too no matter real value. 
	  "ShellsRadius": 90, determines if shells will have spreading. Works same way as SpreadRange. Per mode value will be used if HasShells is true for this mode.
	  "MinShellsDistance": 30, Minimum distance missile have to fly before explode. Min value 30.
	  "MaxShellsDistance": 100, Distance from end of trajectory where missile should separate. Min value 20
								 Note: example - trajectory length 200, min 80, max 100 - missile will separate 100m from end.
									   example 2 trajectory length 100, min 80, max 100 - missile will separate 20m from end cause it have to fly 80m until separation. 
									   example 3 trajectory length 100 min 120, max 200 - missile will not separate at all. 
	  "Unguided": false, for missiles effect only. If true missile trajectory will be strait line instead of curvy. Like it is unguided as old WW2 rockets. 
						True value tied IndirectCapablea and AlwaysIndirectVisuals to false
					logic: if ammo unguided is true - launch will be unguided no matter mode and weapon settings, 
					if ammo unguided is false or not set i'm looking at mode. if mode unguided is true launch will be unguided,

	  "IsAMS": false, - if true this weapon acts as AMS. It will not fire during normal attack. But tries to intercept incomming missiles.
						rude model: every 10 meters of missile fly path there is check, if it in range of any AMS. 
						If so, AMS have AMS.AMSHitChance + missile.AMSHitChance chance to shoot missile down. Avaible shoots count of AMS is decrementing.
						If AMS have no shoots avaible it will not shoot. At end of turn AMS shoots count set to AMS.ShootsWhenFired.
						If missile intercepted, no further checks will be made. 
						Commentary: as you can see, if missile fly path is short chance to be shooted down is less. 
						If missiles is few, and fly path is long chance to be shooted down grows rapidly. 
						AMS can become jammed, have damage-on-jam option and so on. AMSHitChance and ShootsWhenFired can be updated in AMS ammo or mode.
						AMS uses ammunition and heated while firing. Damage and on hit status effects will on be applied. 
	  "IsAAMS": false - if true, weapon acts as advanced AMS, it will fire all missiles from enemies in range, not only attacking.
						NOTE! AMS can be setted by mode, ammo and weapon. Mode have priority, than ammo, and then weapon. 
						NOTE! If you weapon shoots as AMS in current round you can't use it in offensive mode (if any) until next round.
							  On other hand if you fired weapon this round you will not be able to use this weapon as AMS until next activation completes 
						NOTE! Every weapon effect can be used as visuals for AMS fire (missile, machine gun, ballistic, laser, gauss) you can experiment,

								I can't use existing "ArmorDamageModifier" and "ISDamageModifier" cause 
								  1) it is unknown what damage must be displayed in HUD

   "AMSHitChance": 0.0, - if this weapon is AMS, this value is AMS efficiency, 
                         if this weapon is missile launcher this value shows how difficult to intercept missile with AMS. Negative value - is harder,

                   Notes: AOECapable will force AlwaysIndirectVisuals to true. 
				             So it is good idea to use only missile weapon effects unless i've implement indirect visuals for ballistic effect.
				          AOE projectiles always miss no matter toHit values, this is cause AOE dealt only AOE damage.
						     So it is good idea to set -10 for AccuracyModifier to help AI understand fact that AoE weapon always inflicts damage.
						  AOE shots can inflict heat damage. It value based on weapon heat damage per shot and decreasing linear by distance between target and impact base point.
						  Projectiles intercepted by AMS will not cause AOE damage.
						  AOE to hit effect will be implemented to all targets in AoE range. 
						  On fire weapon effects will be implemented to real target only
						  Base point of AoE range calculations will be point where first projectile,
						            (if weapon have ShotsWhenFired > 1) not intercepted by AMS, hits ground.
						  It is recommended to use LRM5, LRM10, LRM15 or LRM20 as weapon subtype cause other subtypes have too huge spread when misses
						  It is good idea to set ForbiddenRage for AoE weapon and set NotUseInMelee to true
						  AOE weapon can't hit mech head, cause every headshot inflicts pilot injury. With fact AoE always dealt damage it will be imbalance. 
						  Damage variations for AoE weapon should not be used cause it will lead completely wrong result 
  "AOEDamage": 0 - if > 0 alternative AoE damage algorithm will be used. Main projectile will not always miss. Instead it will inflict damage twice

  "ShellsRadius": 90, determines if shells will have spreading. Works same way as SpreadRange. Per mode value will be used if HasShells is true for this mode.
  "MinShellsDistance": 30, Minimum distance missile have to fly before explode. Min value 30.
  "MaxShellsDistance": 100, Distance from end of trajectory where missile should separate. Min value 20
							 Note: example - trajectory length 200, min 80, max 100 - missile will separate 100m from end.

  "ISDamageModifier" : 1, Inner structure damage modifier
                        Note: if armor can be breached with this shot more complicated formula will be used - 
						part of damage will remove rest armor, rest part of damage will be multiply to ISDamageModifier. 
						example target have 10 armor, ArmorDamageModifier - 2, ISDamageModifier - 0.2, damage 10.
						5 points of raw damage will remove 10 armor. Rest 5 points of raw damage will inflict 1 = (5*0.2) damage to IS
						consolidated damage will be 5+1 = 6. 
	"CanBeExhaustedAt": 0.5 - if greater than 0 enables per ammo exhaustion mechanic. At end of attack sequence each uses in this attack ammo box is checked.

								(CanBeExhaustedAt - (ammo level)) / (ammo level) chance to be exhausted. Which means component become destroyed without explosion.	
								Example: ammo box has capacity 10, ammo has CanBeExhaustedAt - 0.5, current ammo upon check - 4. Exhaustion chance = (0.5 - 0.4)/0.5 = 0.2
								Note: if current ammo is 0, Exhaustion chance become 1. One ammo box checked once per attack. Ammo ejections initiates exhaustion check too.

					if ammo unguided is false or not set i'm looking at mode. if mode unguided is true launch will be unguided, 
					if mode unguided is false or not set i'm looking at weapon.
