By exchanging the propellent for a newer blend and swapping out the explosive core for a shaped charge the missiles’ aerodynamic structure was able to be refined. This lead to an all around improvement in accuracy through improved aerodynamics and fin stabilization. Upon receiving a Critical Hit, any remaining ammunition stored inside an Ammo Bin will explode dealing damage to the install location. Risk can be mitigated with the use of C.A.S.E. \n\n <b><color=#00ffff>Left Click on Chance to hit during battle to swap Ammo Type</color> </b>",
