WARNING! Shipped versions of AIM can't be loaded by ModTek and can't be used standalone.
WARNING! This version of CAC can be used only with ModTek 0.7.6.5+ cause it utilizes dynamic enums for subsystem for AmmoCategory 

click on right side of HUD weapon slot to switch mode (near hit chance)
click on center of HUD weapon slot to switch ammo (near ammo count)
ctrl+left click on weapon slot will eject current ammo 
ctrl+T will toggle attack direction marks visibility (circles under mechs feets)
NOTE: ammo can't be ejected if mech moved this round
     after ejection mech can't jump and sprint until end of round
    
NOTE: You can modify weapon accuracy on specific range via unit statistic parameters
X - firing distance
CACMinRangeAccuracyMod - 0 < X < MinRange
CACShortRangeAccuracyMod - MinRange <= X < ShortRange
CACMediumRangeAccuracyMod - ShortRange <= X < MediumRange
CACLongRangeAccuracyMod - MediumRange <= X < LongRange
CACExtraLongRangeAccuracyMod - LongRange <= X < MaxRange


Additional unit statistic
CACAPProtection - boolean - if true unit is protected from all AP damage including AP crits. If armor is absent crits will be rolled anyway
CACAoEDamageMult - float - multipicator for all AoE damage to unit including AoE heat and stability if applicable. (Working for weapon attacks, landmines and component explosions)
CACAPDamageMult - float - multipicator for all AP damage to unit (only pierce through part of damage)
CACIncomingHeatMult - float - multipicator for all incoming heat (weapon attacks, landmines, burning terrain, AoE damage)
CACIncomingStabilityMult - float - multipicator for all incoming stability (weapon attacks, landmines, burning terrain, AoE damage)

"AmmoCookoff":{ - AmmoCookoffSettings
					Ammo explosions roll a chance to explode every time your mech overheats, and they roll a more severe chance if you overheat enough to force a shut down.
					By default, these values are 10% per box, and 20% per box respectively.
					there are some settings on how the chances work, and they should be self-explanatory.
  "Enabled":false, - enable or disable AmmoCookoff mechanic overall 
  "OverheatChance":10,
  "ShutdownHeatChance":25,
  "UseHBSMercySetting":true

"AdvancedCirtProcessing":true, - if false vanilla crit processing used. Eg only mechs, crit to can inflicted to empty slot. 
                                If true crit to occupied slots and to mechs, vehicles and turrets. 
"APMinCritChance": 0.1, - Minimal crit chance on AP processing.
                          Basics: 
                            advanced crit calculations:
                              normal crit: crit chance = Max(Constants.ResolutionConstants.MinCritChance, (1 - <current structure>/<max structure>))
                              so minimal value is Constants.ResolutionConstants.MinCritChance maximum 1 (if structure near zero). If random roll less than this value crit success if grater - no crit
                              AP crit:
                                 basic crit chance = Max(APMinCritChance, (1 - <current structure>/<max structure>))
                                 armor shards mod = 1 + (1 - <current armor>/<max armor>)*weapon.APArmorShardsMod. 
                                 armor thickness mod = (1f - armor / weapon.APMaxArmorThickness) if weapon.APMaxArmorThickness = 0 armor thickness mod is 1.0. 
                                 if armor greater weapon.APMaxArmorThickness and weapon.APMaxArmorThickness grater than zero armor thickness mod = 0 (mean no AP crit)
                                 weapon ap crit mod = weapon.APCriticalChanceMultiplier (if weapon.APCriticalChanceMultiplier = 0, weapon ap crit mod set to 1.0)
                                 crit chance =  basic crit chance * armor shards mod * armor thickness mod * weapon ap crit mod
                                 Main idea: weapon can have two mechanics of armor piece - solid core and cumulative jet
                                    first one cause shards from previously damaged armor hit components increasing crit chance
                                    second one have limited cumulative jet length and can't penetrate armor if too thick 
"DestroyedComponentsCritTrap":true, - if true destroyed component can be crit trap. Eg destroyed components is involved in crit roll but crit to destroyed component do nothing. 
"CritLocationTransfer": true, - if true if there no components suitable for crit roll in mech's location crit will be transfered arm/leg->side torso->center torso 
"NoCritFloatieMessage": false, - if set enables or disables criticals floatie messages. If omitted it tries to detect MechEngineer, if detects consider as true (eg. no floatie messages)
"RemoveFromCritRollStatName": "IgnoreDamage", - on criticals resolution components having this staistic set as true will be excluded from list of available for crit. 
                                                NOTE! excluding from list have side effect with CritLocationTransfer enabled. If in location there are only components with IgnoreDamage:true 
                                                it consider as empty and crit will be transfered to another location according transfer logic.

  },
  "ShotsPerAmmo": 1,              - shots per ammo. Example: you have effective shots count = 4 and ShotsPerAmmo = 0.5. After fire ammo will be decremented by 2 (4 * 0.5)
                                    Mutiplicative per weapon, ammo, mode. Default value 1. NOTE: Ammo decrement value rounded to nearest integer. 
                                    If it will be less than 0.5 - it will be your own problem - no ammo will be used.
  "InternalAmmo":{                - starting ammo capacity per ammo id.

  },
  "preFireSFX":"Play_PPC3",       - sound played on weapon's fire !!!CAN!!! be set per mode, ammo, weapon. Mode have priority than ammo and than weapon.
  "blockWeaponsInMechLocations": [], - list of mech locations. all weapons installed in this locations can't fire if this weapon is functional.
                                       NOTE: weapon can block itself.
  "CanBeBlocked": true               - if false weapon can't be blocked by other weapons presents (default is true).
  "blockWeaponsInInstalledLocation": true - if true this weapon blocks weapons in location it installed. Weapon block itself until CanBeBlocked is false
  "EjectWeapon": true,                 - if true weapon become non functional (without explosion) instead of ammo ejection on eject ammo command. 
                                         Can be used to unblock other weapons. Default false.
  "AOEEffectsFalloff": false, if true and weapon inflicts AoE damage, random roll will be permitted before onHit effect apply. 
                              Example: aoe range = 100m, projectile hits ground in 30m from combatant - onHits effects will be applied with 0.7 chance ((100 - 30) / 100).
  "isHeatVariation": true, - if true heat damage will be altered using DamageVariance/DistantVariance/DistantVarianceReversed values. Per mode/ammo/weapon.
  "isStabilityVariation": true, - if true stability damage will be altered using DamageVariance/DistantVariance/DistantVarianceReversed values. Per mode/ammo/weapon.
  "isDamageVariation": true, - if true normal damage will be altered using DamageVariance/DistantVariance/DistantVarianceReversed values. Per mode/ammo/weapon.
  "DamageNotDivided": false, - if true and ImprovedBallistic and BallisticDamagePerPallet are true also damage(heat and stability) will not be divided by ProjectilesPerShot.
  "APDamage": 10, - damage amount always inflicted to inner structure trough armor. If armor breached this damage will be added to normal damage. Additive per mode/ammo/weapon, default 0.
  "APCriticalChanceMultiplier": 0.5, - armor pierce crit chance multiplier. Additive per mode/ammo/weapon, default 0.
                                  NOTE: if effective APDamage > 0 crit roll is placed anyway. But if even if APDamage = 0 and APCriticalChanceMultiplier is set per mode ammo or weapon crit will be placed on each hit without damage to inner structure (like AP autocannon ammo). So weapon can inflict AP damage + AP crit or AP crit alone.
                                  To have APCriticalChanceMultiplier apply normally AdvancedCirtProcessing should be true.
                                  On crit resolve if there is still armor > 0 in location crit chance will be multiplied to APCriticalChanceMultiplier (if set). 
                                  Consider to be used to lower crit chance if trough armor. If there no armor in location crit chance will not be altered.

  "EvasivePipsIgnored" : 1, This value can be controlled via weapon's EvasivePipsIgnored statistic value (float)
  "ProjectileSpeedMultiplier": 0.1, - projectile speed multiplier. Less is slower. Multiplicative per weapon/mode/ammo. Works only with ImprovedBallistic true (ballistic/laser/ppc/missile)
                                     NOTE! Do not set this to low values cause if projectile flying takes too long attack sequence will be terminated by timeout.
                                     NOTE! For lasers ProjectileSpeed it is duration so greater value will result longer firing 
                                        (opposite for other effects greater value makes projectiles fly faster and lower duration).
  "MissileVolleySize": 5, - volley size override for missile launchers. Only works with ImprovedBallistic true. 
                             Some basics: every missile launcher model have emmiters. Launcher counts number of emmiters as volley size. 
                             If model not setuped properly launcher effects it fallbacks to one emmiter with weapon object position so volley size always 1. 
                             You can use this to override this behavior. 
  "ProjectileScale": {"x":10,"y":10,"z":10}, - scale for projectile. Only works with ImprovedBallistic true or IsAMS/IsAAMS (only for AMS fire sequence). 
                                                Works properly only for missiles/autocannons/gauss/ppc. Impact effects and missiles explosions scales accordingly.
                                                Can be set per mode/ammo/weapon. Higher priority replace lower priority value. Mode have priority, than ammo, than weapon.
  "ColorsTable" : [ - Colors array per weapon
    {
      "C":"red"     - Color in html notation. Note for ballistic and ppc effect color can be not fully accurate. If color can't be parsed fallback color is magenta
      ,"I":5        - Color intensivity, used only for lasers 
    },
    {"C":"orange","I":5},{"C":"yellow","I":5},{"C":"green","I":5},{"C":"aqua","I":5},{"C":"blue","I":5},{"C":"purple","I":5}
  ],
  "ColorSpeedChange": 7, - Color change speed. Approximately this number shows how many colors changed during projectile flying. Per mode/ammo/weapon. 
                            Higher priority replace lower priority value. Mode have priority, than ammo, than weapon. 0 counts as not set so will be used next value by priority.
  "ColorChangeRule": "Linear", - Color changing rule. Possible values
                                 None - original color
                                 Linear - colors chanded one by one from start of weapon's colors table
                                 Random - color will be choosed randomly from weapon's colors table. On change while firing next color will be choosed randomly also.
                                 RandomOnce - color will be chosen randomly as projectile start and will not be changed during firing. 
                                 t0 - color with index 0 will be choosen from weapon's colors table and will not be changed during firing. 
                                 t1 - color with index 1 will be choosen from weapon's colors table and will not be changed during firing. 
                                 ........................................................................................................
                                 t31 - color with index 31 will be choosen from weapon's colors table and will not be changed during firing. 
                                 Higher priority replace lower priority value. Mode have priority, than ammo, than weapon. "None" counts as not set so will be used next value by priority.
                                 If color need to be changed it is always changed smoothly. 
                          NOTE! Changing colors avaible only for ImprovedBallistic true or IsAMS/IsAAMS (only for AMS fire sequence) and only for laser/ppc/autocannon effects.
                          NOTE! Coloring of missile trail possible too but only for normal missiles (not AMS) and without changing while flying. Eg ColorSpeedChange for missiles trail if useless
                          ColorChangeRule - Linear equivalent t0,  Random = RandomOnce. 
                          NOTE! "I" value in color table is used for missile trail too (consider be around 2, but you can experiment)
  "MissileFiringIntervalMultiplier": 10, - multiplier for firing interval. Only for missile firing effect. Only works with ImprovedBallistic true. Greater is slower. 
                                     NOTE! Do not set this to very high values cause if delay will be too long  attack sequence will be terminated by timeout.
  "MissileVolleyIntervalMultiplier": 10, - multiplier for missile volley fire interval. Only for missile firing effect. Only works with ImprovedBallistic true. Greater is slower. 
                                     NOTE! Do not set this to very high values cause if delay will be too long  attack sequence will be terminated by timeout.
                                     Some basics: every missile launcher prefab have emiter points. For example your missile launcher prefab have 3 emmiters and you lauching 4 missiles, 
                                     than missile fire sequence looks like: 
                                     missile 0 launch (emmiter 0) -> delay (firing interval) -> missile 1 launch (emmiter 1) -> delay (firing interval) 
                                       -> missile 2 launch (emmiter 2) -> delay (volley interval) -> missile 3 launch (emmiter 0)
  "FireDelayMultiplier": 10, - multiplier for multi-shot fire delay. Only works with ImprovedBallistic. Default for weapon 10. Multiplicative per weapon/mode/ammo. For ammo and mode default is 1.
                              !PLEASE READ NEXT NOTE CAREFULY: Now ImprovedBallistic works for lasers and PPCs, but laser ans PPC effects has no shotDelay parameter in assets which ballistic has. 
                              So, for laser and PPC effects i have to use other parameter for shot delay. This parameter is projectileSpeed.
                              For lasers projectileSpeed controls beam duration, so improved laser fire sequence looks like: beam (projectileSpeed duration) -> delay (projectileSpeed*FireDelayMultiplier) -> next beam
                              For PPC projectileSpeed it is projectile speed, so improved PPC fire sequence looks like: 
                                pulse start -> pulse fly (duration distance/projectileSpeed) -> pulse hit -> delay ((distance/projectileSpeed)*FireDelayMultiplier) -> next pulse start

								  if first projectile hit, rest hit too (location distribution as cluster hit generator),
								  if first projectile misses, rest misses too
								  if not set weapon hit generator will be used.
								  if not set hit generator will be choosed by weapon type.
								  if weapon define has tag "wr-clustered_shots", "Cluster" hit generator will be forced.

  "DamageOnJamming": true/false, - if true on jamming weapon will be damaged
  "DestroyOnJamming": true/false, - if true on jamming weapon will be destroyed (need DamageOnJamming to be set true also)
  "FlatJammingChance": 1.0, - Chance of jamming weapon after fire. 1.0 is jamm always. Unjamming logic implemented as in WeaponRealizer
                              NOTE! There FlatJammingChance can be altered via CACFlatJammingChance statistic value per actor's and/or per weapon's statistic collections
  "GunneryJammingBase": 5, - 
  "GunneryJammingMult": 0.05, - this values uses to alter flat jamming chance by pilot skills 
                                  formula effective jamming chance = FlatJammingChance + (GunneryJammingBase - Pilot Gunnery)* GunneryJammingMult
								  if FlatJammingChance = 1.0, GunneryJammingBase = 6, GunneryJammingMult = 0.1, GunnerySkill = 10
								  result = 1.0 + (6-10)*0.1 = 0.6
								  GunneryJammingBase if ommited in weapon def., ammo def. and mode def. assumed as 5. 
  "DisableClustering": true/false - if true ProjectilesPerShot > 1 will affect only visual nor damage. If omitted consider as true.
  (not used any more)"NotUseInMelee": true, - if true even AntiPersonel weapon type will not fire on melee attack, AI aware. 
  "AlternateDamageCalc": false, - if true alternate damage calc formula will be implemented 
                              DamagePerShot = (damage from weaponDef + (damage from ammo) + (damage from mode)*(damage multiplayer from ammo)*(damage multiplayer from mode)*(damage with effects)/(damage from weaponDef)
  "AlternateHeatDamageCalc": false, - same as  AlternateDamageCalc but for heat 
  "AlternateInstabilityCalc": false, - same as  AlternateDamageCalc but for instability 
  "AMSHitChance": 0.0, - if this weapon is AMS, this value is AMS efficiency, 
                         if this weapon is missile launcher this value shows how difficult to intercept missile with AMS. Negative value - is harder, 
						 positive is easer.
  "IsAMS": false, - if true this weapon acts as AMS. It will not fire during normal attack. But tries to intercept incomming missiles.
                    rude model: every 10 meters of missile fly path there is check, if it in range of any AMS. 
					If so, AMS have AMS.AMSHitChance + missile.AMSHitChance chance to shoot missile down. Avaible shoots count of AMS is decrementing.
					If AMS have no shoots avaible it will not shoot. At end of turn AMS shoots count set to AMS.ShootsWhenFired.
					If missile intercepted, no further checks will be made. 
					Commentary: as you can see, if missile fly path is short chance to be shooted down is less. 
					If missiles is few, and fly path is long chance to be shooted down grows rapidly. 
					AMS can become jammed, have damage-on-jam option and so on. AMSHitChance and ShootsWhenFired can be updated in AMS ammo or mode.
					AMS uses ammunition and heated while firing. Damage and on hit status effects will on be applied. 
  "IsAAMS": false - if true, weapon acts as advanced AMS, it will fire all missiles from enemies in range, not only attacking.
						NOTE! AMS can be setted by mode, ammo and weapon. Mode have priority, than ammo, and then weapon. 
						NOTE! If you weapon shoots as AMS in current round you can't use it in offensive mode (if any) until next round.
							  On other hand if you fired weapon this round you will not be able to use this weapon as AMS until next activation completes 
						NOTE! Every weapon effect can be used as visuals for AMS fire (missile, machine gun, ballistic, laser, gauss) you can experiment,
						      but some effects is more suitable.
  "AMSShootsEveryAttack": false, - if true AMS will not share AMS.ShootsWhenFired between all missile attacks this round. 
                                       Every missile attack will cause AMS.ShootsWhenFired shoots. 
								   if false AMS will shoot AMS.ShootsWhenFired per round
  "AMSImmune": false - if true, weapon missiles is immune to AMS and none AMS will try to intercept them. Can be set for mode ammo and weapon
  "MissileHealth": 1, - health of missile. Used while AMS working. If missile health become 0 missile counted as intercepted. Additive for ammo, mode, weapon.
  "AMSDamage": 1, - damage AMS inflicting to missiles subtracting from missile health on success hit. Used while AMS working. If missile health become 0 missile counted as intercepted. Additive for ammo, mode, weapon.
  "AOECapable" : false, - if true weapon will included in AOE damage calculations. If true set in weapon definition 
                            all shoots will have AoE effect (even for energy weapon). If true, it can't be overridden by ammo.
  "AOERange": 100, - Area of effect range. If AOECapable in weapon is set to true this value will be used. If AOECapable is true, it can't be overridden by ammo.
  "AOEDamage": 0 - AoE damage. 
  "AOEHeatDamage": 0 - AoE heat. 
  "AOEInstability": 0 - instability AoE damage 
  "SpreadRange": 0, - Area of projectiles spread effect. If > 0 projectiles will include in spread calculations. Per weapon, ammo, mode values are additive.
                         if used for missiles, and target have AMS it will fire no matter if it is not advanced and target is not primary.
  "IFFDef" : "IFFComponentDefId", if not empty and target have component with such defId it will exclude form AoE and spread targets list. 
                                   if not empty weapon owner will be excluded form AoE and spread targets list anyway even it has no suitable IFF component.
								   supposed weapon have IFF transponder for own projectiles. If not empty ammo transponder has priority, than mode, and than weapon
								   There is special transponder name "_IFFOffile" - if transponder defId set as IFFOffline it counts as have no transponder at all.
  "HasShells": true/false, if defined determinate has shots shrapnel effect or not. If defined can't be overriden by ammo or mode. 
                            Shells count is effective ProjectilesPerShot for this weapon/ammo/mode.
                            Damage per shell - full damage per projectile / ProjectilesPerShot
                            Only for missiles, ballistic and gauss effects.
							NOTE! If ImprovedBallistic is false HasShells considered as false too no matter real value. 
  "ShellsRadius": 90, determines if shells will have spreading. Works same way as SpreadRange. Per weapon value will be used if HasShells is true for this weapon.
  "MinShellsDistance": 30, Minimum distance missile have to fly before explode. Min value 30.
  "MaxShellsDistance": 100, Distance from end of trajectory where missile should separate. Min value 20
                             Note: example - trajectory length 200, min 80, max 100 - missile will separate 100m from end.
							       example 2 trajectory length 100, min 80, max 100 - missile will separate 20m from end cause it have to fly 80m until separation. 
								   example 3 trajectory length 100 min 120, max 200 - missile will not separate at all. 
  "Unguided": false, for missiles effect only. If true missile trajectory will be strait line instead of curvy. Like it is unguided as old WW2 rockets. 
          Have no influence to indirect fire curvy
					logic: if ammo unguided is true - launch will be unguided no matter mode and weapon settings, 
					if ammo unguided is false or not set i'm looking at mode. if mode unguided is true launch will be unguided, 
					if mode unguided is false or not set i'm looking at weapon. 
					if weapon unguided is true launch will be unguided if not set or false launch will be guided
  "FireTerrainChance":1, - chance to fireup hex cell. Additive for weapon, ammo and mode
  "FireDurationWithoutForest":1, - duration of fire if hex cell has no forest, if > 0 even hex cell with no forest will burn. 
                                  If cell have forest burn period is max from FireDurationWithoutForest and BurningForestTurns
								  additive for weapon mode and ammo.

  "FireOnSuccessHit" : true, - if true roll to fire hex cell will be permitted even on success hit. In that case fire hex cell will be detected as current target position. 
                               if false only projectiles that hits ground have chance to fire terrain. If ommited in weapon ammo and mode supposed as false.
							   mode value have priority, than ammo and than weapon.
					NOTES: expanding logic each turn each burning cell (no matter having forest or not) have BurningForestBaseExpandChance to expand no neighbour cell with forest 
					       burning cell not counted as forest.
						   If mech or vehicle ending move in burning cell they suffer heat damage. For mech it is heat damage, for vehicle it is normal damage splitted by all locations except turret.
						   Damage inflicted to vehicle that way are not cause critical damage to internal components only armor and structure.
						   Fired cell not saved on battle save/reload.
   "FireTerrainCellRadius":6, - radius in in-game cells to fire check roll. On impact each hex cell containing at least one map cell with in radius will have chance to be burned

   "Cooldown": 2, - number of rounds weapon will be unacceptable after fire this mode
   "ImprovedBallistic": true, - whether use or not own ballistic/laser/PPC/missile weapon effect engine. 
								Difference between "improved" and vanilla engine:
								1. Improved mode uses ShotsWhenFire properly (vanilla had not used them at all)
								2. Improved mode can use curvy trajectory for indirect fire (ballistic only) (indirect gauss bullet can be used too, but looks very funny)
								3. Improved mode fire ShotsWhenFire volleys with ProjectilesPerShot bullets in each. 
								   Bullets/beams/pulses in one volley fired simultaneously instead of one by one (as in WeaponRealizer)
								   But damage still dealt once per volley, not per bullet, to keep compatibility with vanilla.
								NOTE! If ImprovedBallistic is set DisableClustering is forced to true and "wr-clustered_shots" tag removed from definition. 
  "BallisticDamagePerPallet": true - if true damage inflicted per pallet instead of per shot. Only working with ImprovedBallistic true, ballistic/laser/PPC weapon effect and HasShels false
                                     Damage will be divided by ProjectilesPerShot value, heat damage and stable damage too.

    "APCriticalChanceMultiplier": 0.5, - armor pierce crit chance multiplier. Additive per mode/ammo/weapon, default 0.
                                    NOTE: if effective APDamage > 0 crit roll is placed anyway. But if even if APDamage = 0 and APCriticalChanceMultiplier is set per mode ammo or weapon crit will be placed on each hit without damage to inner structure (like AP autocannon ammo). So weapon can inflict AP damage + AP crit or AP crit alone.
                                    To have APCriticalChanceMultiplier apply normally AdvancedCirtProcessing should be true.
                                    On crit resolve if there is still armor > 0 in location crit chance will be multiplied to APCriticalChanceMultiplier (if set). 
                                    Consider to be used to lower crit chance if trough armor. If there no armor in location crit chance will not be altered.
                                    If AdvancedCirtProcessing is false crit will still be rolled but chance will not be altered. 
    "ProjectileSpeedMultiplier": 1, - projectile speed multiplier. Less is slower. Multiplicative per weapon/mode/ammo. 
                                       NOTE! Do not set this to low values cause if projectile flying takes too long attack sequence will be terminated by timeout.
    "MissileFiringIntervalMultiplier": 10, - multiplier for firing interval. Only for missile firing effect. Greater is slower. 
                                       NOTE! Do not set this to very high values cause if delay will be too long  attack sequence will be terminated by timeout.
    "MissileVolleyIntervalMultiplier": 10, - multiplier for missile volley fire interval. Only for missile firing effect. Greater is slower. 
                                       NOTE! Do not set this to very high values cause if delay will be too long  attack sequence will be terminated by timeout.
                                       Some basics: every missile launcher prefab have emiter points. For example your missile launcher prefab have 3 emmiters and you lauching 4 missiles, 
                                       than missile fire sequence looks like: 
                                       missile 0 launch (emmiter 0) -> delay (firing interval) -> missile 1 launch (emmiter 1) -> delay (firing interval) 
                                         -> missile 2 launch (emmiter 2) -> delay (volley interval) -> missile 3 launch (emmiter 0)
    "FireDelayMultiplier": 1, - multiplier for multi-shot fire delay. Only works with ImprovedBallistic. Default for weapon 10. Multiplicative per weapon/mode/ammo. For ammo and mode default is 1.
                                !PLEASE READ NEXT NOTE CAREFULY: Now ImprovedBallistic works for lasers and PPCs, but laser ans PPC effects has no shotDelay parameter in assets which ballistic has. 
                                So, for laser and PPC effects i have to use other parameter for shot delay. This parameter is projectileSpeed.
                                For lasers projectileSpeed controls beam duration, so improved laser fire sequence looks like: beam (projectileSpeed duration) -> delay (projectileSpeed*FireDelayMultiplier) -> next beam
                                For PPC projectileSpeed it is projectile speed, so improved PPC fire sequence looks like: 
                                  pulse start -> pulse fly (duration distance/projectileSpeed) -> pulse hit -> delay ((distance/projectileSpeed)*FireDelayMultiplier) -> next pulse start

							   even if you are not supply this weapon with ammo.
		  "AMSHitChance": 0.0, - if this weapon is AMS, this value is AMS efficiency, 
								 if this weapon is missile launcher this value shows how difficult to intercept missile with AMS. Negative value - is harder, 
								 positive is easer.
	  "SpreadRange": 0, - Area of projectiles spread effect. If > 0 projectiles will include in spread calculations. Per weapon, ammo, mode values are additive.
							 if used for missiles, and target have AMS it will fire no matter if it is not advanced and target is not primary.
	  "IFFDef" : "IFFComponentDefId", if not empty and target have component with such defId it will exclude form AoE and spread targets list. 
									   if not empty weapon owner will be excluded form AoE and spread targets list anyway even it has no suitable IFF component.
									   supposed weapon have IFF transponder for own projectiles. If not empty ammo transponder has priority, than mode, and than weapon
									   There is special transponder name "_IFFOffile" - if transponder defId set as IFFOffline it counts as have no transponder at all.
	  "HasShells": true/false, if defined determinate has shots shrapnel effect or not. If defined can't be overriden by ammo or mode. 
								Shells count is effective ProjectilesPerShot for this weapon/ammo/mode.

								 Note: example - trajectory length 200, min 80, max 100 - missile will separate 100m from end.
									   example 2 trajectory length 100, min 80, max 100 - missile will separate 20m from end cause it have to fly 80m until separation. 
									   example 3 trajectory length 100 min 120, max 200 - missile will not separate at all. 
	  "Unguided": false, for missiles effect only. If true missile trajectory will be strait line instead of curvy. Like it is unguided as old WW2 rockets. 
          Have no influence to indirect fire curvy
					logic: if ammo unguided is true - launch will be unguided no matter mode and weapon settings, 
					if ammo unguided is false or not set i'm looking at mode. if mode unguided is true launch will be unguided, 
					if mode unguided is false or not set i'm looking at weapon. 
					if weapon unguided is true launch will be unguided if not set or false launch will be guided

  "FireOnSuccessHit" : true, - if true roll to fire hex cell will be permitted even on success hit. In that case fire hex cell will be detected as current target position. 
                               if false only projectiles that hits ground have chance to fire terrain. If ommited in weapon ammo and mode supposed as false.
							   mode value have priority, than ammo and than weapon.
					NOTES: expanding logic each turn each burning cell (no matter having forest or not) have BurningForestBaseExpandChance to expand no neighbour cell with forest 
					       burning cell not counted as forest.
						   If mech or vehicle ending move in burning cell they suffer heat damage. For mech it is heat damage, for vehicle it is normal damage splitted by all locations except turret.
						   Damage inflicted to vehicle that way are not cause critical damage to internal components only armor and structure.
						   Fired cell not saved on battle save/reload.
   "FireTerrainCellRadius":6, - radius in in-game cells to fire check roll. On impact each hex cell containing at least one map cell with in radius will have chance to be burned

	  "IsAMS": false, - if true this weapon acts as AMS. It will not fire during normal attack. But tries to intercept incomming missiles.
						rude model: every 10 meters of missile fly path there is check, if it in range of any AMS. 
						If so, AMS have AMS.AMSHitChance + missile.AMSHitChance chance to shoot missile down. Avaible shoots count of AMS is decrementing.
						If AMS have no shoots avaible it will not shoot. At end of turn AMS shoots count set to AMS.ShootsWhenFired.
						If missile intercepted, no further checks will be made. 
						Commentary: as you can see, if missile fly path is short chance to be shooted down is less. 
						If missiles is few, and fly path is long chance to be shooted down grows rapidly. 
						AMS can become jammed, have damage-on-jam option and so on. AMSHitChance and ShootsWhenFired can be updated in AMS ammo or mode.
						AMS uses ammunition and heated while firing. Damage and on hit status effects will on be applied. 
	  "IsAAMS": false - if true, weapon acts as advanced AMS, it will fire all missiles from enemies in range, not only attacking.
						NOTE! AMS can be setted by mode, ammo and weapon. Mode have priority, than ammo, and then weapon. 
						NOTE! If you weapon shoots as AMS in current round you can't use it in offensive mode (if any) until next round.
							  On other hand if you fired weapon this round you will not be able to use this weapon as AMS until next activation completes 
						NOTE! Every weapon effect can be used as visuals for AMS fire (missile, machine gun, ballistic, laser, gauss) you can experiment,
						      but some effects is more suitable.
  "BallisticDamagePerPallet": true - if true damage inflicted per pallet instead of per shot. Only working with ImprovedBallistic true, ballistic weapon effect and HasShels false

    "FireDelayMultiplier": 1, - multiplier for multi-shot fire delay. Only works with ImprovedBallistic. Default for weapon 10. Multiplicative per weapon/mode/ammo. For ammo and mode default is 1.
                                !PLEASE READ NEXT NOTE CAREFULY: Now ImprovedBallistic works for lasers and PPCs, but laser ans PPC effects has no shotDelay parameter in assets which ballistic has. 
                                So, for laser and PPC effects i have to use other parameter for shot delay. This parameter is projectileSpeed.
                                For lasers projectileSpeed controls beam duration, so improved laser fire sequence looks like: beam (projectileSpeed duration) -> delay (projectileSpeed*FireDelayMultiplier) -> next beam
                                For PPC projectileSpeed it is projectile speed, so improved PPC fire sequence looks like: 
                                  pulse start -> pulse fly (duration distance/projectileSpeed) -> pulse hit -> delay ((distance/projectileSpeed)*FireDelayMultiplier) -> next pulse start

						  AOE shots can inflict heat damage. It value based on weapon heat damage per shot and decreasing linear by distance between target and impact base point.
						  Projectiles intercepted by AMS will not cause AOE damage.
						  AOE to hit effect will be implemented to all targets in AoE range. 
						  On fire weapon effects will be implemented to real target only
						  Base point of AoE range calculations will be point where first projectile,
						            (if weapon have ShotsWhenFired > 1) not intercepted by AMS, hits ground.
						  It is recommended to use LRM5, LRM10, LRM15 or LRM20 as weapon subtype cause other subtypes have too huge spread when misses
						  It is good idea to set ForbiddenRage for AoE weapon
						  AOE weapon can't hit mech head, cause every headshot inflicts pilot injury. With fact AoE always dealt damage it will be imbalance. 
						  Damage variations are not applying to AoE damage
  "AOEDamage": 0 - if > 0 alternative AoE damage algorithm will be used. Main projectile will not always miss. Instead it will inflict damage twice 
                            one for main target - direct hit (this damage can be have variance) and second for all targets in AoE range including main. 
  "AOEHeatDamage": 0 - if > 0 alternative AoE damage algorithm will be used. Main projectile will not always miss. Instead it will inflict damage twice 
                            one for main target - direct hit (this damage can be have variance) and second for all targets in AoE range including main. 
  "AOEInstability": 0 - instability AoE damage 
  "SpreadRange": 0, - Area of projectiles spread effect. If > 0 projectiles will include in spread calculations. Per weapon, ammo, mode values are additive.
                         if used for missiles, and target have AMS it will fire no matter if it is not advanced and target is not primary.
  "IFFDef" : "IFFComponentDefId", if not empty and target have component with such defId it will exclude form AoE and spread targets list. 
                                   if not empty weapon owner will be excluded form AoE and spread targets list anyway even it has no suitable IFF component.
								   supposed weapon have IFF transponder for own projectiles. If not empty ammo transponder has priority, than mode, and than weapon
								   There is special transponder name "_IFFOffile" - if transponder defId set as "_IFFOffline" it counts as have no transponder at all.
  "HasShells": true/false, if defined determinate has shots shrapnel effect or not. If defined can't be overriden by ammo or mode. 
                            Shells count is effective ProjectilesPerShot for this weapon/ammo/mode.
                            Damage per shell - full damage per projectile / ProjectilesPerShot
                            Only for missiles, ballistic and gauss effects. Should not be used with AoE.
							NOTE! If ImprovedBallistic is false HasShells considered as false too no matter real value. 
  "IsAMS": false, - if true this weapon acts as AMS. It will not fire during normal attack. But tries to intercept incomming missiles.
					rude model: every 10 meters of missile fly path there is check, if it in range of any AMS. 
					If so, AMS have AMS.AMSHitChance + missile.AMSHitChance chance to shoot missile down. Avaible shoots count of AMS is decrementing.
					If AMS have no shoots avaible it will not shoot. At end of turn AMS shoots count set to AMS.ShootsWhenFired.
					If missile intercepted, no further checks will be made. 
					Commentary: as you can see, if missile fly path is short chance to be shooted down is less. 
					If missiles is few, and fly path is long chance to be shooted down grows rapidly. 
					AMS can become jammed, have damage-on-jam option and so on. AMSHitChance and ShootsWhenFired can be updated in AMS ammo or mode.
					AMS uses ammunition and heated while firing. Damage and on hit status effects will on be applied. 
  "IsAAMS": false - if true, weapon acts as advanced AMS, it will fire all missiles from enemies in range, not only attacking.
					NOTE! AMS can be setted by mode, ammo and weapon. Mode have priority, than ammo, and then weapon. 
					NOTE! If you weapon shoots as AMS in current round you can't use it in offensive mode (if any) until next round.
						  On other hand if you fired weapon this round you will not be able to use this weapon as AMS until next activation completes 
					NOTE! Every weapon effect can be used as visuals for AMS fire (missile, machine gun, ballistic, laser, gauss) you can experiment,
						  but some effects is more suitable.
  "ShellsRadius": 90, determines if shells will have spreading. Works same way as SpreadRange. Per mode value will be used if HasShells is true for this mode.
  "MinShellsDistance": 30, Minimum distance missile have to fly before explode. Min value 30.
  "MaxShellsDistance": 100, Distance from end of trajectory where missile should separate. Min value 20
							 Note: example - trajectory length 200, min 80, max 100 - missile will separate 100m from end.
								   example 2 trajectory length 100, min 80, max 100 - missile will separate 20m from end cause it have to fly 80m until separation. 
								   example 3 trajectory length 100 min 120, max 200 - missile will not separate at all. 
  "UnseparatedDamageMult": 0.8, Damage multiplier applying to shell missile which hadn't separated due to short trajectory length

  "ISDamageModifier" : 1, Inner structure damage modifier
                        Note: if armor can be breached with this shot more complicated formula will be used - 
						part of damage will remove rest armor, rest part of damage will be multiply to ISDamageModifier. 
						example target have 10 armor, ArmorDamageModifier - 2, ISDamageModifier - 0.2, damage 10.
						5 points of raw damage will remove 10 armor. Rest 5 points of raw damage will inflict 1 = (5*0.2) damage to IS
						consolidated damage will be 5+1 = 6. 
	"CanBeExhaustedAt": 0.5 - if greater than 0 enables per ammo exhaustion mechanic. At end of attack sequence each uses in this attack ammo box is checked.
	                           if it has (ammo level) = (current ammo/ammo capacity) LESS than CanBeExhaustedAt for this ammo it has 
								(CanBeExhaustedAt - (ammo level)) / (ammo level) chance to be exhausted. Which means component become destroyed without explosion.	
								Example: ammo box has capacity 10, ammo has CanBeExhaustedAt - 0.5, current ammo upon check - 4. Exhaustion chance = (0.5 - 0.4)/0.5 = 0.2
								Note: if current ammo is 0, Exhaustion chance become 1. One ammo box checked once per attack. Ammo ejections initiates exhaustion check too. 
    "Unguided": false, for missiles effect only. If true missile trajectory will be strait line instead of curvy. Like it is unguided as old WW2 rockets. 
          Have no influence to indirect fire curvy
					logic: if ammo unguided is true - launch will be unguided no matter mode and weapon settings, 
					if ammo unguided is false or not set i'm looking at mode. if mode unguided is true launch will be unguided, 
					if mode unguided is false or not set i'm looking at weapon. 
					if weapon unguided is true launch will be unguided if not set or false launch will be guided

Note on damage modifiers
you can register your own modifier via API
	void CustAmmoCategories.DamageModifiersCache.RegisterExternalModes(string id, - id should be unique
		Func<Weapon, string> nameDelegate,                                    - delegate not get name of your modifier base on weapon and you internal weapon's state
																					  if you return string.Empty or null next delegates will not be invoked
		Func<Weapon,float> damageDelegate,                                     - delegate for damage. Function should return multiplier
		Func<Weapon, float> apDelegate,                                       - delegate for AP damage. Function should return multiplier
		Func<Weapon, float> heatDelegate,                                     - delegate for heat. Function should return multiplier
		Func<Weapon, float> stabilityDelegate                                 - delegate for stability. Function should return multiplier
	)
if your internal state for weapon has bee changed you should invoke 
	void CustAmmoCategories.DamageModifiersCache.ClearDamageCache(this Weapon weapon) to clear damage calculations cache for weapon. 
    Invoking weapon panel slots refreshing is also your responsibility and should be performed after cache reseting

Note on toHit modifiers
