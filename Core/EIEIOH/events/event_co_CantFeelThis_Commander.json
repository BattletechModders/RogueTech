How do you feel?\" beams Darius.\r\n\r\n\"Ugh, I hurt all over, and my head is pounding too.\"\r\n\r\nThe surgeon moves into your view, \"That is to be expected, Commander.  There were serious complications, but we were able to pull you through.  You will need extended rehab and simpod training over the next few months before you will be well enough to go out into the field.  It may also take up to 2 years for you to regain 100% of your coordination back though.\"\r\n\r\nDarius leans in, \"The extra time healing and training will set us back nearly 4x the initial costs.\"\r\n\r\nYou smile, \"The cost is irrelevant, Darius.
