    "Details" : "Enhanced Imaging Neural Implants formed part of the Clans' Enhanced Imaging system and were useful only when combined with a BattleMech, ProtoMech or Battle Armor equipped with an Enhanced Imaging Display. The implants themselves consisted of electronic sensors, fiber-optic wires and contact points connected to a warrior's central nervous system. Implanted just below the skin they were visible as faintly luminous lines in colors such as red, blue or green.",
