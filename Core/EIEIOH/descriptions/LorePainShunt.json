    "Name" : "Pain Shunt",
    "Details" : "A Pain Shunt was less of an implant and more a surgical procedure employed by the Manei Domini which allowed a person to ignore pain, whether from an injury sustained or the chronic headaches caused by their other implants, by bypassing the pain centers of the brain. While making the operative largely incapable of feeling agony, it also caused clumsiness due to the deadening of the user's tactile senses. Operatives who undergo this procedure take a whole year to relearn how to manipulate objects without accidentally breaking them, but are much harder to effectively stun or put down afterwards.",
