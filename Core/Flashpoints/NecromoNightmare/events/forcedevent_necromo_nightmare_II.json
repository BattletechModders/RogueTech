What we have here is an old ComStar Transponder, something that is nearly impossible to obtain nowadays.\"\r\n\r\nYang raises his hand. \"I think we will need to equip a 'Mech with it and then strap that 'Mech on to the hull of the Argo. Keep it off our ship itself, if we don't we will be attracting ROMS from two jumps away. We can sweep in grab the Mechwarriors and leave.\" \r\n\r\nSumire rubs her temples. \"I disagree with Yang. We're going to have to change our ship's IFF completely... I mean, if I am reading this correctly. In 30 days there will be an opening for ComStar vessels to slip through and investigate Necromo's primary base. With this on we can get to the planet just in time for the show. We can blow this abomination off the face of the universe once and for all; And not risk further Infection.\"",
