Is that\u2026 a pumpkin?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe screen zooms to max and painted on the hull is an orange pumpkin with a face and the words\r\n\r\n<i><color=#FFA500>TRICK</color> OR <color=#FFFF00>TREAT</color></i>\r\n\r\nnext to it. \r\n\r\nDarius scratches his head, \u201CWhat does that mean?\u201D\r\n\r\nDr Murad steps forward, \u201CI believe it is a reference to an old Terran holiday known as Halloween.  Originally a day to remember the dead, it transitioned into a holiday where Terran children would dress up in costumes and go door to door to be given treats, usually in the form of candy.\u201D\r\n\r\nYou look at Dr Murad, \u201Cso what is the Trick?\u201D\r\n\r\nDr Murad smiles, \u201CSome residences would try to scare the children or play pranks on them and what not.\u201D\r\n\r\nYou ponder this information, \u201CSo, there are two access doors on the dropship, one for Trick and one for Treat.
