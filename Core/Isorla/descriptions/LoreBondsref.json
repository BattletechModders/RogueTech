  "Name": "Bondsref",
  "Details": "A warrior whose personal honor would not allow them to serve as a bondsman could avoid this fate through ritual suicide known as a bondsref. Prior to being claimed by the victor and given a bondcord, a warrior could take their own life or have an accomplice kill them and so 'refuse the bond.' Once a bondcord had been given, the bondsref could only be performed with the permission of the bondholder; to do otherwise was considered a cowardly and dishonorable act..",
