  "Name": "Bondswoman",
  "Details": "A Bondswoman was a prisoner taken during combat by a Clan, of any caste or rank, who was held as an indentured servant. Bondswomen were bound by tradition, rather than chains, to work dutifully for their new masters. For a bondswoman to purposefully neglect their responsibilities or even attempt escape stained not just their personal honor but the honor of their original Clan. Typically, a bondswoman would either be released from their bond and sent back home, with little honor lost, or after a given period of time, be adopted and become a free, full member of their new Clan. When and whether an individual was released from their servitude varied between Clans and individuals: some only spent a token amount of time before being freed from their bondscord, while others would live out the rest of their lives as bondswomen.",
