    "Details": "Star Commander Holli Jones has an inherent ability to read the battlefield and know where to go to hit the enemy.  Not every battle goes to plan and a critical hit to her mech's sensors and ECM suite led to her defeat and capture as a bondswoman.  Cool and collected under fire, the others joke she has liquid nitrogen for blood and have taken to calling her 'Nitro'.  \n\n",
