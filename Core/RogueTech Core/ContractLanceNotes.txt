Cargo made most of the stuff in this folder so direct your questions and hatemail that way if something seems wrong.

I'm going to present some documentation since not many people seem to understand the contract and lance system.

----------------
Lances Overview: Lance files define sets of units that may spawn together to fill a certain role. Most of the time when a Contract needs to spawn some mechs, or vehicles or turrets it looks for a Lance that fits a set of tags. That lance in turn dynamically selects units that fit it's own criteria. So a mission might say it needs a Support lance of mechs, it finds a lance that's marked as being that. Then that lance picks 4 units. The lance might be set to pick 2 Fire Support units, 1 Vanguard unit and 1 "Tank" unit. So it spawns a Jagermech, a Trebuchet, a Jenner and a Centurion respectively. Two long range, one fast, and one tough. (Preset lances which spawn specific units also exist but are not generally used). A unit's tags let it be picked by a lance. A lance's tags let it be picked by a Contract.

We've altered the vanilla ones and added many new lance types.

Convoy: These are vanilla lances that spawn APCs for convoy missions. Our version of the pilot used by these units lives in RogueTanksCore.

Deprecated: These are all the vanilla lances (often in modified form for previous version of roguetech). They are now all BLACKLISTED because we now use completely custom lances for our spawner.

MixedAgnosticBattle: These lances don't care if the unit they spawn is a mech or vehicle. They only care about weight class and role tags. These are the one set of lances that spawns things in the old style, left for variety sake.

OpForConvoy: These are vehicle lances that are not allowed to spawn things with the "unit_hover" or "unit_noconvoy" tags. They are otherwise identical to VehicleBattle. These lances are only callable by a contract that specifically looks for the OpFor Convoy tag.

SoloMech: This contains vanilla assassination target lances modified to spawn Elites. Additionally there are a handful of custom lances with varied support units assisting the target.

Mech/Vehicle/Mixed Battle - Fully random unit roles.

Cavalry - No Support units - This is supposed to be mobile direct combat units.

Fire - Two Assassin units, Two Anything but Vanguard - This should trend toward heavy solid units with heavy firepower.

Recon - 2 Vanguard units, 2 Units anything but Tank - Should trend toward faster units.

Support - Two Support units, two that can't be Assassin - Should trend toward long range and scout/guard units

------------------------------

Building custom Lances:

The Difficulty you give your lance is the single most important thing determining whether ot not it gets used in a given situation. If you want to be sure your lance can spawn at any stage of the game you need to make a version of it for difficulties 1-10

Beware of putting "unit_lance_xxxxx" tags in the Excluded Tags field. Many units have several role tags and you could accidentally create a very small pool of candidates.

The unit type bit at the start doesn't do anything. Only tags matter. If you say that slot is for a "Mech" but make "unit_vehicle" a required tag you will get a tank.

Tags are just strings. You can make your own put them on units and then make a lance that searches for that tag.

------------------------------

Contracts Overview:

An exception to the rules stated for lances above. A contract may be set to spawn specific units directly rather than going through a lance as a middleman. This is how the story missions work. Use them for reference. But briefly the lance ID must be set to "Manual" Then each unit must be named by ID for each position. If you want an individual unit in the lance to by dynamically selected set it's ID to "Tagged" then enter unit tags in it's fields just as you would in a lancedef.

Contract files contain many settings for missions, as well as all the text dialog and determine what kinds of lances spawn.

Ambush Convoy missions have been altered to select a type of lance that can't spawn fast units.

Base Defense Missions have been altered to always spawn allied turrets; enemy difficulty has also been increased.

Misc bugfixes for vanilla contracts are included, they're detailed in the changelog below.

------------------------------

Contract Notes:

SimpleBattle_SettlingAGrudge_Hard spawns the first lance from Locals and the ambush lance from target team for some reason.

CaptureEscort_SaveThePrototype - With Steiner Employer, kurita target and owner, spawned blocking force from Clan Wolf, rein and hunter lances from Kurita

------------------------------

Planned:

Make MixedRecon, VehicleFire, VehicleRecon

ToDo- Urgent

Write description for All Quiet on the Western Frontal
Make reinforcement toggle system for Frontal Assault.
Figure out what the heck is up with the objectives on BreakthroughBrink, what makes an objective hidden?
