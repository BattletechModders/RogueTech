CHANGELOG!
=========
KNOWN ISSUES - READ THEM!
=========

- Check https://roguetech.gamepedia.com/Performance_Tips for Performance Tipps

- GamePass version of the game will not work with RT.

- If an update fails, try first to reboot your PC. Windows probably locks some dll and the patcher cant overwrite it

- Combat saves and mission restarts are permanently disabled

- Loading a save from inside the career/battle fails sometimes. Restarting the game before loading saves is recommended. Also, never start a new game after exiting to main menu from existing game, always restart the game first.

- Randomly occurring duplicated defaults or default/fixed equipment making mech invalid - store and ready the mech to fix.

- Not being able to hire pilots/pilots don't appear in barracks after hiring - save and reload before hiring to fix

- May crash when alt-tabbing during modtek load

- Pilot portraits staying blue after using sensor lock, known issue, no fix

- Cannot deploy during first contract - Save and reload to fix

- Purple mechs, purle ECM bubbles - shaders failed to initialize, happens randomly, try waiting before pressing begin combat after mission loads

- RogueTech for linux requires some extra steps as outlined on the wiki install guide

- Purple artillery explosions, purple fires - shaders fail to link on Linux/Mac, select "Old Fire" in the installer

- Mission Control can sometimes take its time to find a drop spot when randomized spawns are enabled

- Clicking deploy button does nothing - remove warnings on your mechs. Yes, even the underweight one. Yes, even if you deployed a 1000 times with it

- If you go into career and cant open the mechbay.  Restart your game. If that failed, Please make a ticket

- Ams laser animation sometimes doesn't go away.  We are sending in comstar security to arrest it for indecent ams laser exposure.

- Do NOT! use the older steam overlay, it crashes HBSBT 1.9

- Do not touch pilots stats while they are fatigued or injured. If you did, retrain pilot to get skills working again.

- Knockdowns/Overheating can cause Zombie mechs that are dead, but do not count towards mission completion, fixes are in the works.

- Overheat+Knockdown at the same time can cause softlock when done to a player mech

- Certain specific pilots start gaining massive amounts of exp as they approach fully leveled up. (Integer overflow with bonus exp quirks)

- Vehicles with no Turret location can appear to take structure damage when still have armor. This is a visual glitch only.

- Some contracts have objective triggers tied to enemy shooting at you, most notable ambush lance in Simple Battle. If you kill the entire lance without letting them shoot at you, mission will not complete. Notice that allies are not "you". Avoid killing entire lances you dont have objectives for.

- On Target Aquistion missions, do not put all your mechs into evac zone before evac objective appears, mission will not complete.

- Mech that falls as a result of minefield explosions could end at the same hex as other mech and become untargetable, cant be fixed unfortunatelly, use AOE weapons to kill it.

- Do not move your last mech into evac zone by melee attack on target in evac zone, game will softlock.

- Installing ANY CheatHappens trainers will get you banned from online map

- Designmask effects (burning, radiation, etc) are applied to LAMs multiple times if you transform multiple tiems

- If you have mech stuck in queue in "Done" state, delete Mods folder, reinstall RT and go back to save before it was put into queue

- Do not assemble new units from parts and ready from storage at the same time, can result in disappearing units.

- Do not abort ready from storage orders, can result in disappearing units.

- You can use RogueTechSaves/local/modsettings/CustomVoices.json to control custom sounds (chopper, jets, etc) volume if you don't like defaults.

- Sometimes attack direction is incorrect. This manifest as mech getting damage on the location facing way from attacker or Offensive Push showing weird percentages or not letting some bodypart to be selected. 

- Mechlab Glitch: Editing Battle Armor, Superheavy mechs or anything else that has modified slots may cause the Mechlab to glitch when you open up something else later. Restart the game to fix this.

- The Mechlab will currently show as a weapon using multiple slots if a location has both Omni and standard hardpoints. This is just a visual bug, and the validation once modifications of the 'Mech are done will work as intended.

Increased chance for receiving a bondsman from most Isorla Bondsman events.
Flying Tigers - Fix for player given unit never being a VTOL.
Removed the poor maintenance tag from the escort lances of several contracts to prevent their engines spawning as damaged, resulting in one hex movement only.
The bonus/malus to hit units that are considerably lighter/heavier has been tweaked. Every 20 ton in difference will now result in +/-1 in accuracy, was every 15 tons. Maximum modifier remains at +/-5.
Added +1 Defense Bonus and Grants Guarded to Water and Deep Water terrains. Added heatsink bonus to Deep Water.
Hunchback HBK-6H - New RT custom variant, Civil War era.

Pulse lasers have had a rework. They have since Roguetech was first created been based on a special house rule to make them unique, but many weapons have since been added pushing them to be weaker than intended, with many stock units suffering as a result. The weapons are also very weak against squad type units due to the spread of multiple shots hitting multiple units.
- Standard Inner Sphere Pulse Lasers have been changed to fire a single shot, but at the same total damage. Special variants have been tweaked, and retain their pulse behaviour.
- Most Clan Pulse Lasers have had their clustering chance increased.
Most small non-pulse lasers have had a +1 accuracy bonus against Battle Armor and Protomechs added.

**Lance-A-Lot 2.0.0**

Note: This release is **NOT* save breaking even though it will introduce some major features and changes. Any pre-existing career should load fine.

Vehicle Refitting - It is now possible to do some basic refit of vehicles, allowing limited customization of their loadouts. 
- It **ONLY** allows replacing weapons and ammunition boxes part of the vehicles *stock loadout*. Additional weapons or ammunition boxes can **NOT** be added, and no other types of equipment can be added, replaced or removed. Certain weapons are also not possible to replace. 
- The replacement of weapons and ammunition boxes follow a set of rules and restrictions, see below.
- Refitting and repairing after combat is not instant, it will now require c-bills and time like with 'Mechs. Any replaceable item that was destroyed during combat will need to be replaced by another item from the inventory.
- Vehicles assembled from parts or restored from storage will have all replaceable weapons and ammunition boxes showing as destroyed. These items will have to be replaced manually from the inventory before the vehicle can be used for missions.
- Weapon Replacement Rules: The replacing weapon must be of same hardpoint type, have same or less weight, slots and heat generation. Artillery and Railguns count as their own hardpoint categories. Bolt-on weapons use the carry weight instead of standard weight.
- Some weapons can not be replaced, mainly those that would only be allowed once on a 'Mech or are not salvageable.
- Some weapons are not allowed at all due to requiring parts vehicles don't have like Cockpit or Arm actuators.
- Ammunition Box Replacement Rules: Any replacement ammunition boxes must have the same or less weight and slots.
- Weapon Attachments can not be removed or added, but they will be connected to a replaced weapon if that weapon supports the attachment.
- The armor amount of vehicles can be lowered. However, this brings no real benefit as it is not possible to add anything that uses more weight than it did in the stock loadout.

Salvage 2.5 - Tweaks have been done to the salvage system that allows salvaging whole 'Mechs has been improved and changed as follows.
- Mechs: The chance for a full mech to be available for salvage now depends on the career setting for amount of parts needed to assemble a unit.
- Vehicles: It is now possible to salvage whole vehicles after combat, like with 'Mechs. The chance to recover a full Vehicle also depends on the career setting for amount of parts needed to assemble a unit.
- Another change to vehicle salvage is that salvage will no longer be dropped for items that can not be refit, preventing double dipping of the salvage pool by both taking parts and the items.
- Squads: The salvage parts for squad units have now been changed to have a percentage based chance to recover each part, based on the career setting for amount of parts needed to assemble a unit.

Strategic Objectives - From now on the common denominator for all missions that involves fighting a very large enemy unit such as Dropships or Mobile Fortresses.
- Currently there are four different contracts for Strategic Objectives. They all reward loot boxes with increasing amount of picks and rarity of items.
- Strategic Objective: Union Busting: Fighting an Union dropship. Two variants exist. Easiest Strategic Objective.
- Strategic Objective: The King's Horses: The previously available fight against an Overlord dropship. Its weapon loadout and armor has been improved to slightly increase its difficulty.
- Strategic Objective: Kerensky's Folly: Fight against a SLDF Rattler Mobile Fortress. Likely impossible for most players, as the Rattler has extreme amounts of armor and weapons.
- Strategic Objective: Climbing the Aggro Crag: Fight against a Word of Blake Rattler Mobile Fortress. Likely impossible for most players, as the Rattler has extreme amounts of armor and weapons.

Combat Updates
- Fixed issue with too restrictive firing arc check if the target is very close.
- Fix for ambushes not working at difficulty 10 or higher.
- Fix for issues with Battle Armor dismount tracking.
- Fix for Battle Armor hitting the carrying unit when firing from internal ports.

Many VTOLs and some vehicles have been rebalanced due to breaking the rules for carry capacity and to prepare for the new vehicle refit feature.
Fixes to Isorla bandsman, KFC event chain and MRB Authorization Upgrade Available events.
St Burt Pilot Event - Contract Missions that result in Unknown MechWarriors re-enabled. Unknown MechWarriors will receive an event to wake them up eventually. St Burt Mech event is still inactive for now.
VTOL/LAM Training - Events are reenabled and fix for stuck careers. Event will now only trigger for single pilot that player can accept or reject to train. If a pilot comes out of timeout without getting the training result, an event will eventually trigger to enable pilot skill for that pilot.
Dire Wolf 'DireStar (Mech) - Added custom unique Enhanced Imaging (C-DS) cockpit. Prevents ejection.
New Quick Sell UI now enabled by default.

**HHR** 1.2.0
Superheavy Contracts (NEW FEATURE):
- This feature is only enabled if the optional module Superheavys is selected during installation of RogueTech.</font>
- Generation and game play with contracts where Superheavy units can appear has been majorly reworked. Instead of just rare missions that appear at higher difficulties there now is a full system for these contracts, which seperates them from standard contracts.
- New Argo upgrades allows unlocking Superheavy contracts, without them no Superheavy Contract will ever generate.
- Many new superheavy Contracts have been added. There are now three new distinct categories of Superheavy contracts: Challenge, Conflict and Hunt (very hard).
- The first upgrade in the chain of new Argo upgrades to enable Superheavy contracts can not be granted retroactively, but is free to build.
- More extensive information of this feature can be found on the Superheavy Contracts wiki page: https://roguetech.fandom.com/wiki/Superheavy_Contracts
Drop value per difficulty increase has been adjusted slightly, since a lot of things have changed cost without it being properly adjusted for a long time.
MRB Console - New Argo upgrade subcategory. Has no impact unless Superheavys mod is installed.
All standard duel contracts now limit each dropped unit to a maximum weight of 100 tons.
All existing contracts that could spawn Superheavy units (except flashpoints) have been reworked to fit in with the new Superheavy Contracts feature.
Many Specialist item had their cost tweaked.

Centrospheric Flywheel - New specalist equipment. Increases movement speed based on tonnage of Mech. Superheavy Mechs only.
Weapon Mount Recoil - The Jam reduction was too strong, meaning placing any weapon with Jam not in arms clearly suboptimal in most cases. As a result the Jam Chance modifier has been changed from -30% to -15%.
3 new standard and 48 new superheavy mechs.
MechWarrior  'Capt. Jack' - Fix for special pilot quirk Pirate WiFi never triggering its positive outcome.
Droppable Thumper Shell - Fix for missed shots landing hundreds of meters away. Range increased.
Many railguns were too strong for the required weight and slots, and have been adjusted.
Many other tweaks and fixes, see wiki changelog for full list.

**IMPORTANT: THIS RELEASE IS SAVE BREAKING - YOUR OLD SAVES WILL *NOT* WORK WITH IT**

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

These Release Notes are just an excerpt of the largest changes in the release. For full details visit https://roguetech.fandom.com/wiki/ChangeLog.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Handhelds and Specialist slots rework
====
Handheld and Specialist equipment have now been split to two separate categories on the 'Mech.

Specialist items are now mounted at the top of each side torso, while handhelds are mounted in each arm.
Using a non-melee handheld will prevent any weapon in that arm from firing until the handheld is dropped.
To drop a handheld, the same action as dropping ammunition is done, simply SHIFT-click the item in the weapons list.
Dropped handhelds will be recovered at the end of the mission.
Combat Changes
All physical Weapons were also reworked as part of the larger Handheld rework. Their damage is now more based on the attacker Chassis Tonnage and less fixed damage.
This will make melee builds for heavier 'Mechs and reduce the damage potential of smaller 'Mechs by stacking modifiers.

The main trait of each Melee weapon class is now:

Maces - Highest damage per attacker tonnage.
Swords - Lower damage per attacker tonnage, higher fixed damage.
Hatchet - Middle ground between Maces and Swords.
Vibroswords - Similar to Swords. Has an active mode that adds more fixed damage instead of percentage bonus.

As part of these changes Punch Stability damage has been reduced from 0.5 per attacker Chassis Tonnage to 0.25.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Mechbay Update
====
The Argo Mechbay has been reworked to more clear.

Quirk, Armor and Structure is now shown in a separate widget in the upper left corner.
The hardpoint icons have been improved, including a new Omni icon and two new Hardpoint types: Wingmounted and Internal Bomb Bay.

Advanced information have been added to some tooltips:
- The tooltip shown when hovering over the weight of the 'Mech now shows Armor and Structure weights and modifiers.
- The tooltip of the Engine now also properly shows the actual weight of the Gyro.
- The tooltip of the handheld carry capacity shows a more detailed breakdown of each hand and limits.
- The Heat Efficiency meter has been improved to support Laser Heatsinks. Its tooltip has been made more detailed showing at what phase heat is generated and sunk, and what the net delta is.
- The Armor modifiers (+ / - buttons) now support holding ALT to step for values of 25. SHIFT still moves a single point and CTRL moves max or min. The Max Armor button has also been improved to be more consistent.

Sorting of Equipment has been improved. Some categories are still a bit messy, this will be fixed post-release.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Skirmish Mechbay
====
The Skirmish Mechbay has been greatly optimized and now allows an ingame way to quickly load up any 'Mech and experiment with builds. The Mechbay can be accessed from the game's initial main menu, Skirmish -> Mech Bay.

Before entering the Mechbay a new screen is shown which allows filtering the data by several options such as era, weight class, etc.
The free text field on this screen allows filtering on chassis name, specific unit tags, tonnage and many other parameters.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

New 2765 Map - Star League Era
====
A new Map is available, representing the 2765 Star League era.

The map will be used for Season 4 in Roguetech Online. It is selectable as an option for singleplayer installs.
Factions have been updated to match the proper factions during the era, adding the following:
* Amaris Empire
* Rim Worlds Republic
* SLDF
* Terran Hegemony

Starting units while using the map have been changed to the era appropriate ones. Stores and RTO factory goods have been changed to match the technology level of the map.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Resolve per Pilot
====
Due to a rising amount of available modifiers it has for some time been too easy to generate resolve and use skills extensively. For this reason and to create more tactical gameplay resolve is now generated per pilot instead as a common company pool.

Many of each pilot's actions will generate Resolve for them, e.g. hitting an enemy with majority of fired shots, killing an enemy, making an enemy fall over.
Performing badly can in turn lower a pilot's Resolve, such as hitting friendly 'Mechs or missing all or most of the fired shots.
Base Resolve gained at each round start is based off the Argo Morale, and will go negative if your Morale is low.
All pilot abilities now cost Resolve, the tooltip of each ability will show the amount. Mech or equipment abilities are still free.

Some of the pilot base skills will now give increased Resolve generation or reduced ability cost:
* Each skill point in Guts will increase Resolve generation by 5%.
* Each skill point in Tactics will reduce the cost of Resolve based abilities by 2%.

The modifiers are only generated by the pilot skills, not by the Guts or Tactics' values directly. Adding further Guts or Tactics through other means does therefore not affect the Resolve generation or ability costs.

Equipment can now have modifiers that improve Resolve generation for the whole lance, for just that pilot or reduce the cost for just that pilot.

Important: All cost and generation values might be tweaked depending on feedback and results after release.

LAM and VTOL weapons rework
====

Bombs
----
The way Land Air Mechs carry and use bombs has changed. Previously the bombs were in ammo boxes that used Carry Weight instead of Tonnage, and dropped from a weapon that occupied a Specialist Slot. VTOL had their own system of bombs based on tabletop rules that was unique to them.

As this was confusing and inefficient, all previous LAM and VTOL specific weapons have now been replaced with new versions that can be used by both types of units. Players can salvage bombs, missiles, and gun pods from a downed VTOL and put them on their LAMs!

Key Point: There are now two special categories of Aircraft Weapons: Wing Mounted and Internal Bomb Bays. All LAM and VTOLs can use both types simultaneously.

Wing Mounted
----
Each weapon is self contained, like a rocket launcher, bolt-on, or Handheld. This means no external Ammunition Boxes are needed.
Wing Mounted weapons use up the mech's Carry Weight but do not require Tonnage.
Wing Mounted weapons use special Torso hardpoints, designated with a clawed wing icon, that only LAM and VTOL have.
Wing Mounted weapons cause aerodynamic drag which slows the LAM or VTOL, reducing its movement range.
Wing Mounted weapons also slightly increase the unit's sensor profile.
The penalties to drag and sensor profile can be removed by Ejecting the weapon.
The penalty remains even if the weapon is empty. You must eject it.
Wing Mounted gear is the easier option to augment a traditional mech build.

Internal Bomb Bays
-----
Each Internal Bomb Bay is represented as a weapon that uses a specific hardpoint type for LAMs and VTOLs. The hardpoint icon looks like three small bombs.
All air units have two hardpoints for Internal Bomb Bays, for LAMs one in each Side Torso and for VTOLs both in the front. Internal Bomb Bays weigh 0 tons but require slots.
The full capability Internal Bomb Bay takes 2 slots, variant bays trade capability for smaller size.
Like conventional weapons Internal Bomb Bay weapons use Ammunition boxes, generally containing 1-2 shots per ton.
Because everything is internal, Internal Bomb Bays and their munitions cause no drag or increased sensor signature.
Internal bays offers greater maximum capacities for dedicated bombers with no loss in maneuverability.

LAM changes
----
LAMs lost the 360 firing arc while flying. Instead a new concept is introduced, Bomb Tossing - bombs now have max range influenced by Evasion Pips Gained.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

AMS Overhaul
=====
The crew has felt for a long time that certain AMS have been too powerful in player hands, allowing for gaining easy advantage over long range enemies during the first rounds of a mission. AMS have as a result been overhauled, making them more equivalent and in line with what the crew envisioned.

Machingun / Laser modes removed from nearly all AMS. This mode proved to be a big problem for AI units as it often used this mode with little success instead of intercepting enemy missiles.
All AMS now have a specific limit to the number of times they can activate per round.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Weapon Attachments & Armor Mods
====
To enable more build diversity a number of weapon improvements have been converted into actual attachments. In a similar fashion several new Armor Mod have been created to replace some previous equipment.

Weapon Attachments
----
Attachments are connected to a weapon by placing it in the same location on the 'Mech.
If more than one weapon exists a small cogwheel icon on the Attachment can be used to choose which weapon to attach to.

Each Attachment have requirements for which weapons are compatible, see its tooltip.
Each compatible weapon can have multiple different types of Attachments unless specified otherwise, but never more than one of the same.
Attachments will either add new Firing Modes in combat or modify existing ones.

If destroyed, the new firing modes or the bonus of existing firing mode will be removed.

More Attachments might get added in the future if needs are found.

Fix multinetwork C3 gear


**Mechattan Project** 1.0.3.2
Lots of vehicles gear and quirks updates, advise storing and re-ready any you use
C3 Rework - We are finally able to implement near perfect TT C3
 - It works exactly as TT C3 - members of C3 network use distance of the closer network member to target for purpose of determining range penalties for accuracy.  It doesn't allow firing weapons beyond their max range. If spotting unit is in the min range for a weapon, short range modifier is used.
 - Units inside hostile Active ECM range are kicked from the network, except for Boosted C3 units. Angel ECM cancels even Boosted.
 - There are 3 different networks: Standard Master/Slave network, C3i network, and Nova CEWS network. Standard network requires at least one functional C3 Master to function. Quirk C3 gear usually can participate in both standard C3 and C3i networks.
 - C3 gear may provide various benefits to other members of their network in addition to just participating in targeting calculations.
 - Main differences from TT: there is no limit to numbers of unit in network, you can run multiple C3 Masters in network, ECM only block units inside ECM bubble (do not interrupt link between units on different sides of it).
 - AI implementation - because AI lances are random and dont have C3 cohesion, it works different for AI:
 - All 3 networks are shared for AI (but additional bonuses are only granted to correct network)
 - C3 Master turn all friendly units in 500 meter radius into C3 Slaves. Some quirk C3 Masters turn entire team into C3 Slaves.
Lance (Company wide) bonuses rework
 - All lance bonuses except Resolve Gain are no longer stacking.
 - You will receive the highest bonus among available on the field.
 - Affinities for gear that grants lance bonuses increase base value of the gear. This means that f.e if you have unit with "Tacticon: 1" and affinity "additional +1 Initiative to company units" and another unit with "Tacticon: 3", affinity will not add anything.
Vehicle and turrets should actually receive more crits, both normal and TAC (it was supposed to be like this, but wasn't actually working)
Affinities and pilot quirks with AllLanceMates/AllEnemies effects should now work
Fiona should retain her airstrike ability when retrained and regain it if she already lost it.

**Mechattan Project** 1.0.0.0
  Requires Launcher 1.3.3

**IMPORTANT: THIS RELEASE IS SAVE BREAKING - YOUR OLD SAVES WILL *NOT* WORK WITH IT**

DLC Autodetection
   During the Roguetech installation through the launcher you no longer have to choose which DLC you own. Instead, it will be autodetected as the game is started and only content which you have access to will be enabled.
Offline Mode/WarTech IIC now supports a selectable starting map era:
  - 3040's Map: This is the classic RT map you know and love. All standard factions are available
  - 3080's Map: This is map based on the canonical state of the Inner Sphere circa 3081 - 3085. New canon factions for this era have been added and a number of dead factions have been removed.
  Once you have chosen a map year, you must commit to it, changing map era's mid career is not supported
Kill Teams (Optional) 
  Kill Teams is a new feature in Roguetech to increase late game difficulty and attempt to make the Mod more challenging for those that so desire. The feature enables lances of optimized (non-canon) 'Mechs and Vehicles with elite pilots that might drop as support for the enemy. These 'Mechs have been customized by our team to be as deadly as possible. Attempts to balance the difficulty for these units have been made, but this will be an ongoing process.
  If Kill Teams are enabled, normal contracts will have a limit of one Support Lance per mission.
  Since this means a reduction of amount of standard support lance dropped in a mission on average for contracts between D1  D12, the chance for a single standard support lance drop has been increased.
  However, beginning with contracts at D13 and up, support lance pilots and 'Mechs start being substituted by Kill Teams variants.  Kill Teams units are *REQUIRED* objectives in several mission types. Most Kill Teams units are unable to be salvaged, but any used equipment or weapons usually can be.
Superheavy 'Mechs Rework (Optional) 
  Superheavy Mechs have gone through a major rework to make them more viable and interesting to play. Besides updating the current ones, a large amount of new Roguetech custom designs have also been added to expand this area of the gameplay.
  The list below is a summary of the major changes done to superheavy 'Mechs:
   * The number of slots and hardpoints in each location of the 'Mech has been increased.
   * They now receive less movement penalty in forests, rough or rubble terrain, but does not benefit from roads.
   * They are now susceptible to knockdown when firing large weapons unless braced, but at a decreased chance compared to standard 'Mechs. The higher the tonnage, the less the risk, with the 200 ton 'Mechs totally immune.
   * Armor is more efficient due to the ability to mount more of it, a flat +20% bonus to all locations except the head, which instead gets +100% bonus to make them harder to head shot.
   * Due to their sheer size, they are more stable and therefore take less stability damage.
   * As any MechWarrior piloting such a large 'Mech feels like the king of the world, they get a permanent +2 bonus to Guts as long as they remain in the 'Mech.
   * A new fixed item type, "Superheavy Frame", is mounted in the Center Torso of all Superheavy 'Mechs in various sizes based on the 'Mech tonnage. This item will list the major superheavy specific buffs of the 'Mech.
   * Superheavy Structure, Gyro and Stealth-type of armor have been added, standard 'Mech versions are not compatible.
   * Superheavy equipment, Mechs and Mech parts have been added to faction stores and will appear after two years of in-game time.
   * Certain planets have been given the new tag *Superheavy Industry*, and will now sell Superheavy equipment and Mechs produced on that planet after two years of in-game time. These stores generally have a friendly or honored reputation requirement for the items to appear.
Missile Ammunition Split
  Ammunition for Inner Sphere and Clan missile launchers have been split to be more like in-lore and balance the launchers out. Clan ammunition will generally be harder to find, like the Clan launchers, but most of the time have more interesting statistics. As a result of this split, most specialty ammunition is no longer available on Clan launchers. Society launchers will also use their own ammunition from now on.
  This change affects SRM, LRM, MRM standard launchers, as well as SRM Streak launchers. LRM Streak launchers are already Clan only, so was not changed.  RISC MML launchers have also been switched to use Clan ammunition.
Neural Interface
  A new Neural Implant trait has been added for pilots.
  Pilots without Neural Implants *can not* pilot a Mech with an always-on DNI cockpit, and cockpits with an activatable component will not provide any benefits when activated.
  Neural Implants can be installed via a special surgery that can be purchased as a service in shops in Clan and WoB space, as well as Gamesworlds. Some Ronin pilots come with Neural Implants already installed.
Airlift / Crane
  A new feature to airlift or lift units by crane has been added. So far only a single transport airship and the Loader King IndustrialMech have this feature. It allows the unit to lift any other unit on the battlefield, within its tonnage limitation, and then put it down - or throw it down if enemy. The lifted units can still fire, but not move as long as they are lifted.
Operation Revival (Optional) - New unofficial Content
  Based on the Zhukov series of Alternative Universe TRO's made by *Sharlin* (https://thezhukovau.wordpress.com/), this submod adds a selection of new Clan Mechs and Tanks primarily for the Hell's Horses. Highlights include a speedy UAC/20 hover tank, a 100 ton tank with 90 LRM's and a series of refits of frontline OmniMechs.
  **Used with original creators permission.**
Anti Air Defense
  All pilots got new ability called AA Stance, which can be used instead of attacking. Movement is still available after enabling it.
  Many weapons have a new stat AA Factor, which is used to calculate anti-air capabilities when an Airstrike is about to land as follow:
  The AA Factor of all weapons on all player mechs in AA Stance is added up and then divided by the number of player units on the field. The resulting value is the chance that the strafing fighter will not be able to attack any given unit in the strafe zone.
    Example: You have 8 units. Two units are in AA Stance, one with a combined AA Factor of 250% and one with 150%. 250+150= 400 / 8 =50, so there is 50% chances that the strafing fighter will not attack your units in the strike zone.
  The further increase the chance to prevent airstrikes, there are FCSs, Quirks and BC modules which further multiples the AA Factor value. As they do nothing for AI, specialised FCS AA and AA BC module can only be bought in shops and will not appear in salvage.
All Mech's have gone through a hardpoint rebalance to bring them more in line with what we envision their roles to be. Superheavy Mechs got the largest benefit, greatly increasing their number of hardpoints.
All Mechs and Vehicles costs have been reworked, in most cases resulting in a slight increase for 'Mechs and decrease for Vehicles. This change was made to address the fact that using vehicles as pure direct to sell loot was too good a tactic.
Protomechs Converted to Core Mod
 The previously optional Protomechs mod has been added into the core install, making them always available.
Updated Career Backgrounds
  Added Test Subject.  Neural Implant!  Random Protomech!
  Updated Soldier. No longer completely at the mercy of RNGesus. Added the choice of an energy, ballistic or missile weapon to the day 2 lootbox event.  Review your lance before advancing a day!
Added new Quicsell Outlet stores, with the best deals of the Galaxy!
Sniper, Thumper and Long Tom Oneshot versions can no longer use external ammunition.
As usual the release contains countless small fixes, tweaks and changes - far too many to list here.

**RogueTech MechRiders** 1.2.2.4
Requires Launcher 1.3.0
KnockdownOnFire/BraceToFire mechanic added
  - Some weapons (Railguns, HGRs, Artillery, RAC10/20 on high fire rates) now have a chance to knock the firing mech down by their enormous recoil.
  - Chance is additive for all weapons fired. Chance is reduced by piloting (1% per piloting skill) and mech weight (0.15% per ton). There are some chassis quirks that reduce it too. Quad and SuperHeavy mechs are immune.
  - You can comletely negate knockdown chance by bracing the turn before. So brace, next turn fire without moving will have no knockdown chance.
On Field Resupply/Repair
  - Some vehicles (indicated by "Can Resupply/Repair" in description) can resupply ammo and repair armor in field.
  - Unit in the hex next to such vehicle will get "RESUPPLY" pilot ability. Upon activating both units will shutdown for the time of resupply.
  - Resupply takes 45 phases + 10 phases/ammo ton + 10 phases/50 armor points repaired. Uses special "ammo" on resupply vehicle. Omni-mechs/tanks resupply time is halved.
  - This will not allow you to avoid repair/ammo costs as resupply "ammo" cost more. Nukes are not resupplied.
Battle Armor can now garrison buildings
  - Done by using "Mount/Swarm" on building. Building will take damage instead of BA. If building colapes BA will take fall damage and will be disoriented (-3 accuracy and -5 initiative for 2 turns).
  - Using "Dismount" BA will exit into the same hex it entered from. Holding Ctrl while using "Dismount" BA will exit to the roof.

Added StrategicOperations Mod
 - Major Battle Armor rework to bring them closer to TT values, you will need to store/ready all BAs for them to function properly. You also need to store/ready every vehicle you have that say it has BA bays in description.
 - Battle Armors now can mount friendly units and swarm enemies. Complete explanation can be read here https://github.com/ajkroeg/StrategicOperations
 -- Use Mount ability targeting friendly unit to mount. To dismount use Mount ability targeting the unit BA is attached to. Any BA can mount vehicles with BA bays (this is noted in vehicle description). Most BA can mount Omnimechs. Some BA can mount any friendly unit except VTOLs and LAMs.
 -- Use Mount ability targeting enemy unit to swarm. If swarm is successful BA will attach to target and fire all its enabled weapons at absolute accuracy and with 20% damage bonus. On the following turn use "Done" button to continue swarming, or Mount ability targeting swarmed unit to dismount. VTOLs and LAMs can't be swarmed.
 -- BAs attached externally to a unit regardless friendly or hostile has 33% chance to be hit by shots hitting location BA is attached to.
 -- You can use Swat and Roll (self knockdown) abilities to try to get rid of swarming BAs.
 - Battle Armors can no longer run (have run speed equal to walk speed) or perform DFA (DFA on BAs was always a proxy for swarm)
 - AI units have a chance to spawn with BA attached to them. Chance and maximum number of BAs that can spawn is faction dependent and raise with difficulty. For specifics see https://roguetech.fandom.com/wiki/BattleArmor_Spawn_Pools 
Switch to Modtek 2.0. That shouldn't have any user facing consequences.

**RogueTech Treadnought**

After over 6 Months of Work, and many hours of curses and codemares we proudly present

RogueTech Codename: Operation Treadnought!

The long awaited Tank update!

Crush your enemys under a merciless assault of Demolishers or teach them the horrors of a VTOL Swarm

YOUR OSMIUM SAVES CANNOT BE USED WITH THIS VERSION!

PLAYABLE TANKS!
-Players can now field, buy and salvage tanks!
-These have received a complete overhaul to be completely inline with CBT rules to the last kilogram
-You can now drop up to 12 units at 800 tons (argo upgrades permitting), with 4 of these being restricted to tanks
-Tanks cannot be modified but they offer new tactical options or just sheer firepower
-Toggle in Mechlab between Vehicle and Mechbay

Online Map has returned!
-Including several anti cheat measures and ability to ban exploiters
-You can appeal a autoban by making a ticket on Discord

Complete Skill System and Background Overhaul
-You now have a choice of 2 Abilities at Skill level 5 and 8
-Level 8 Skills are Active Cooldown Based options
-Earn Affinities with Mechs by using them for longer battles
-Training pods reduce and prevent affinity decay
-You Commander now has Quirks!
-Commander Background equipment is granted at day 2

Complete Overhaul of the Shops System
-Shops now have 3 components:
-All shops now stock basic equipment (a mix of introtech weapons, upgrades/heatsinks, ammo, engine cores) in expanded quantities alongside small amounts of uncommon ammo and special slot upgrades (e.g. bolt on weapons) with medium or large population planets offering a wider selection than small population ones.
-As you gain rep, the shops will adjust (only on planet change. Stores are static until you change). At liked rep, you'll see a small number of new tanks (succession wars era) added to the stores, at friendly levels; the faction will sell you some mech parts and at honoured rep; they will offer a random mech for sale (both the mech and the mech parts will also be succesion wars era vintage). Please note that this depends on planet tags so a small population planet will only offer extra tanks, but more populous planets will offer the full range of gear.
-The 3rd component in the new shop system is planet tags. These largely remain the same for the moment, but manufacturing planets will sell 2 random advanced (as in post Helm Core tech) tanks and mining will sell 2 random Succession Wars era tanks.
      
-Shops now stock dlc mechs/mech parts if you own/install the relevant dlc (e.g. flashpoint might put a Crab in your shop)
      
-Installing the Piratetech mod will now offer rare piratetech in the system stores of the major Pirate factions (Valkyrate/Oberon/Circinus/Tortuga) and some piratetech vehicles/mechs in their faction stores.
      
-Faction shops now exist for all factions. These will stock a selection of advanced tanks and mechs/mech parts alongside things like xl engines or endo steel and other upgrades.
      
-Several factions do have slightly different stores/faction stores. WoB and Comstar will stock SLDF Royals in their faction store and occasionally non Royal SLDF mechs in their system stores. 
-Clans will sell Royals and Second Line mechs alongside mostly SLDF era weapons/ equipment in their stores. Clan tech and weapons will be more common as you advance in rep. Faction stores for the clans will sell Omnimechs in place of standard mechs. 
-The Deep Periphery factions such as New Delphi will have smaller stores representing their lower tech levels. They will also be tilted towards a mix of introtech equipment and primititve weapons alogside early mechs and tanks. 

Overhauled Melee System
-Melee now has proper hit locations and types
-Majority of your Weapons may fire during Melee Attacks
-Punches hit the upper locations of a mech and prevent arm mounted weapons from firing
-Charge is a devastating melee attack at sprint distance that deals damage based on weight and distance, no weapons may fire
-Kicks allow to target a mechs legs and prevent leg mounted weapons from firing 
-Physical Melee weapons have unique pro's and con's, use a Mace to ruin their stability or go Headhunting with Swords

Notable Changes:
-New Performance fixes, massive improvements to almost everything!
-Manual Deployments! A Option to chose where you want to drop your forces in Battle
-Overhauled Minefields
-Improved Weapons and Ammo UI
-Overhauled Weapons Crit System. Depending on weapontype and size, they can receive multiple crits before being destroyed
-So many many many changes, often backported to osmium during development

Notable Minor issues
-Ammo based weapons show a 0 in Mechlab. This is for internal Ammo which they dont have. Fix coming soon.

-Emblems are not in company customisation
-Randomly failing to load CustomComponents breaking mechlab (this why you reinstall, if you have it, make a ticket)

New Mechlab function "Specialist Slots"
-All Mech's have a quirk from lore
-Based on a chassis maximum Carry weight
-Used for Hand Held Weapons, self contained carried weapon system
-Specialist items, like some chassis unique items or exchanger and heatbanks
-Melee Items, Hacthets, Maces, Swords, Shields upgrades go there now and use up carry weight (CBT/MaxTech rules, based on very first Hatchetman)
-Bolt On Weapons, these can be used in Melee and range from crappy unguiged rocket packs to plasma lances
-Carryweight: 10% Chassisweight, each hand can carry up to 50% of this, if 2 hands are present, a 25 ton commando can carry a 2.5 ton handheld

New Classic BattleTech Expanded Heat Table and Total Warfare Rules
-Heat Scales on a table from 0-150 heat
-Classic BattleTech Heat effects like slowed down, ammo explosions and pilot damage
-DFA and Melee charge Miss may cause falling down
-Restart from shutdown is now based on HeatSinkCapacity and rolls for it depending on the table
-Stability checks better and dependant on Piloting Skill
-Hull Breaches in low atmosphere condition when structure damage is taken (fairer then a chance every hit) Harjel based system can prevent this

Core has all files for the mechanics, options and submods

Asset bundle contains ALL! REQUIRED! data for the mech models themself

This is to ensure a lower download size for single patches and hotfixes

-----
HIGHLIGHT:
-----

Low Visibility introduction - Double Blind rules!
A greater importance on information warfare and stealth
Anything now plays a role in it, from the Weather to the pilots ability to see

https://github.com/IceRaptor/LowVisibility

At the start of every move a unit makes a sensor check (tactics skill)
This defines what it can see and to what detail
The distance and strength of this check is affected by Sensor Probes (like the Beagle Active Probe)
Countered is this by Stealth and ECM 
roughly: Pilot Skill+Roll+Probe Tier -Ecm -Stealth

You can see what your rolls and modifiers are in among your buff icons!

Introduces advanced sensors and items like UAV, Thermal Vision and Advanced Zoom to help find the enemy and deduce the threat

Low Vis Guide and tips coming to the wiki soon!

- Fixes init overflow bug (init values below 1 return ERROR). Please let me know if you see cases where actors skip their turn.

NOT SAVE COMPATIBLE TO ANYTHING!
REQUIRES CLEAN INSTALL!

Initiative overhaul - https://github.com/IceRaptor/SkillBasedInit
Initiative is now based upon pilots skills, chassis weights, gear and spiced with rng
Some items got tweaked for this function

Weapon Jamming
Weapons can now Jam 
Each level of gunnery above 1 adds 10% chance to avoid a weapon jam and each level adds 10% to unjam. So a level 10 gunnery pilot would have a 90% chance to avoid a weapon jam and a 100% chance to unjam on the next round.
Jamming is based upon recoil of a weapon, reducing recoil also prevents jamming 

New Pilots
Elite Pilots - Highly trained and skilled pilots with unique nicknames
Named Pilots - Elite pilots with extra traits and a unique buff (very WIP)
Tanker Crews - Tanks now have their own selection of "crews", tuned for tank action
New contracts - You are challenged to a duel by a lance of elite pilots
