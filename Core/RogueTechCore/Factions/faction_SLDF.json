    "Description": "The Star League Defense Force (SLDF) was the principal military force defending the Star League, a conglomeration of star systems within roughly 500 light years of Terra. At its height the SLDF was the largest military force known to man, composed of over 100 million soldiers organized into 486 divisions. The Star League Defense Force left the Inner Sphere after fighting the Amaris Civil War, when Stefan Amaris overthrew the ruling First Lord of the Star League, Richard Cameron. After a long series of bloody battles throughout the Star League, Commanding General Aleksandr Kerensky ended the coup with the liberation of Terra and the execution of Amaris. However when no new First Lord could be agreed upon by the Great Houses the Star League was dissolved. Kerensky then led the surviving 113 divisions out beyond the Inner Sphere in Operation EXODUS, hoping to save the essence of the League from the internecine violence that was to come. The SLDF would return 300 years later as the Clans, a technologically superior military that invaded the Inner Sphere in 3049.",
