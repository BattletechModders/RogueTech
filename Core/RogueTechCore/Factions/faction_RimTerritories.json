  "Description": "The Rim Territories is a proto-state officially presented as a mutual defense and trade pact. In truth, it operates as a loose collective of pirate groups, with each world functioning as a criminal fiefdom under the control of its dominant gang or raiding clan. Governed from the capital world of Pain, the Rim Territories thrives on illicit trade, plunder, and under-the-table alliances, while maintaining a thin veneer of legitimacy to negotiate with other factions. This pragmatic and ruthless structure allows the Rim Territories to survive and even profit amidst the chaos of the Inner Sphere.",
