  "Name": "Clan Wolverine",
  "ShortName": "Wolverine",
  "Description": "One of the original twenty Clans, Clan Wolverine was Annihilated in the years after Operation KLONDIKE, officially for having detonated nuclear devices to destroy a genetic repository of Clan Snow Raven and for opposing Nicholas Kerensky and the Clans as a whole. \r\n\r\nThe Clans subsequently went to great lengths to purge Clan Wolverine from their history. They refer to the former Clan Wolverine only as the \"Not-Named Clan\". Instead of properly referring the \"IIC\"-style evolution of the Wolverine BattleMech as the Wolverine IIC, it was renamed the Conjurer (Hellhound). More than two hundred years after Clan Wolverine's annihilation, the mere comparison of a Clan warrior to an animal identified as wolverine, in a completely unrelated situation and by a person not accustomed to Clan society, was still considered a shocking insult that might elicit a violent response.",
