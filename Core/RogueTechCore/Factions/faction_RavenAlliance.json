    "Description": "After Clan Snow Raven lost their holdings and was abjured from Clan Space during the Wars of Reaving, they would seek refuge with their allies in the Outworlds Alliance. Seeing the similarities and benefits between both factions, they would bore a fruitful relationship that would result in the merging of the Raven Alliance after the Jihad ended.",
