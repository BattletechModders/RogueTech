    "Description": "The Rim Collection is a minor nationstate founded by six planets that remembered the old Rim Worlds Republic, pre-Amaris, and wanted to recreate that dream. They are small, democratic, and pretty much harmless. Their military is composed of the mercenary group Able's Aces who have become national heroes for the Collection."
