    "Description": "An amalgamation of the Free Rasalhague Republic and Clan Ghost Bear, the Rasalhague Dominion is a blend of the political, military and cultural styles of Inner Sphere and Clan societies. Founded in 3060 as the Ghost Bear Dominion the new state was isolationist by inclination, only waging war against the Draconis Combine and Word of Blake due to external factors",
