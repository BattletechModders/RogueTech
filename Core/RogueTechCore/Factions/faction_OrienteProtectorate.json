    "ShortName": "Oriente",
    "Description": "The Oriente Protectorate was founded in 3086, after the dissolution of the Free Worlds League. Descended from one of the original founding states of the League, the Oriente Protectorate is a fusion of the Grand Duchy of Oriente, the Protectorate, and the Duchy of Orloff. Oriente is theoretically a representative government, but it operates under military rule, much like the Free Worlds League after the fall of the Star League.",
