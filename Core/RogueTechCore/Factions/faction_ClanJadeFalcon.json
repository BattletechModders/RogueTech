    "Barbarian, if I had so much as a sibko unit nearby, I would have them perform this task instead of you.  However, if you value your c-bills so highly, take this batchall quickly before I change my mind.",

    "Barbarian, the Falcon has faced you in battle before, and you are a competent, if dishonorable warrior.  Take up this batchall and perhaps we can find a more common purpose.",
    "Barbarian, you are an unknown to us.  Prove yourself on the field of battle with this batchall, and we may have further use of you.",
    "You have assisted Clan Jade Falcon in the past.  Continue to be useful by taking up this batchall and we might continue this relationship.",
    "I must admit I am surprised you have been so useful to Clan Jade Falcon.  We offer you this batchall in recognition of your service.",
