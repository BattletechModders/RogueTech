  "ShortName": "Mongoose",
  "Description": "Clan Mongoose was one of the original twenty Clans founded by Nicholas Kerensky, named for the creature on Shadow that preyed upon the dangerous venom worms and thus endeared itself to Shadow's colonists. While the Clan did well enough for itself during the first half of the twenty-ninth century, its heavy reliance upon politics over honorable combat alienated other Clans and eventually sealed its fate when Clan Smoke Jaguar won the right to Absorb them in 2868. After a brutal campaign the Jaguars prevailed and, save for some aerospace pilot heritages taken by Clan Cloud Cobra, Clan Mongoose's legacies ceased to exist.",
