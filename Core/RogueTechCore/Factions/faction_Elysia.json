    "Commander, if you have been attacking the planets of the Elysian Fields for money, we can offer you similar contracts that will preserve our way of life, and I beg you to consider this one.",
    "Welcome to the Elysian Fields, Commander.  We of the One Star faith are simple subsistence farmers and hunter/gathers, and normally have no need for martial forces.  With this task however, you can help, if you wish.",
    "Thank you again for your help in protecting the faithful of the Elysian Fields, Commander.  We would like to employ you once more to defend our faith and way of life, if you are able?",
