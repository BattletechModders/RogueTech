    "Commander, you have constantly been a thorn in the side of the Hanseatic League's desire for mutually profitable trade.  However, if you desire C-Bills so badly, we do have this contract you can undertake.",
    "Commander, your attacks against the Hanseatic League have done little to engender trust between us; perhaps we can reverse this trend with this contract?",
    "Commander, the Hanseatic League is a mercantile alliance; we are traders.  Rather than attack us, let us work together for mutual benefit.",
    "Greetings Commander.  The Hanseatic League has a task requiring a lance of mercenaries such as yours, shall we negotiate on a payment for your services?",
    "Greetings again Commander.  The Hanseatic League once again have a small matter you can assist with, if you would care to negotiate a mutually agreeable payment?",
    "Hello again, friend of the Hanseatic League.  I have kept this profitable contract aside in hopes of meeting with you, shall we discuss it further?",
