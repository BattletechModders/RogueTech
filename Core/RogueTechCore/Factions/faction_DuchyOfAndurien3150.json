        "Greetings, mercenary. Lowly and despicable though you may be, you may yet serve our interests. Finish this job, and we may look upon you with more favor than you likely deserve.",
        "The Duchy Of Andurien has a use for mercenaries like you, Commander. I think you'll be interested in the attached contract. Hopefully we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",
