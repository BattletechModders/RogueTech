    "Description": "Angry at the Wolves for denying his Clan the opportunity to fight on Terra, Khan Amirault stated that he did not recognize Ward as ilKhan and claimed that the Wolves had unfairly denied the Hell's Horses a chance to become the ilClan, while at the same time 'inviting' Clan Jade Falcon to Terra to participate in the planet's conquest. Amirault then demanded a Trial of Refusal against Ward who responded by pointing out that the Wolves were under no obligation to invite the Hell's Horses to Terra, nor had the Horses earned the right to such a consideration.  Ward then stated that there would be no Circle of Equals between himself and Amirault because, as ilKhan and First Lord of the Star League, he had no equal. Amirault, in response, declared that the Hell's Horses would not stand for such an offence and the Horses' delegation publicly declared their nonrecognition of the new ilKhan's authority before the assembled Clan representatives during Ward's coronation as First Lord.  As a consequence of their failure to conquer the rest of the former Jade Falcon Occupation Zone, saKhan Lassenerra accused Khan Amirault of squandering the Hell's Horses position through his hesitancy and overcautiousness, and killed him in a Trial of Position, thereby becoming the new Khan. The Hell's Horses, the Clan was united again and back under the leadership of a true warrior. They began strengthening their military while considering making amends with Alaric.  Always known for their prominent use of combat vehicles in front-line forces, the Hell's Horses lived by the motto that man came before machine and all members were valued as being part of a greater whole, including freebirths.",
