    "Description": "50 years after Clan Diamond Shark officially changes its name back to Clan Sea Fox, they proceed to buy all of the Free Worlds League's ComStar assets and absorbs all Wolf Empire's working and nonworking HPGs.

Clan Sea Fox, after the rise of the IlClan, began bonding mercenary contracts across Federated Suns and Draconis Combine space, quickly replacing the MRBC.",
