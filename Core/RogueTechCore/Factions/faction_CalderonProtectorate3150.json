    "Description": "Untouched by attacks from the Word of Blake, the Protectorate actively worked to improve the fledgling nation's industrial base and used the developing manufacturing resources to help boost the economy through exports. The improved manufacturing base also gave the CPM local sources of supply, and military recruitment picked up both as a result of the more enthusiastic amongst the energized citizens of the protectorate and the swarms of immigrants from the Concordat who fled to the Protectorate to escape the ruling military junta.  The Protectorate further improved its economic base by establishing trade ties with the nearby Filtvelt Coalition and Fronc Reaches, as well as the more distant Raven Alliance - and these ties also helped to secure the Protectorate's borders.  Eighty-one years after the Calderon Protectorate was formed, on 29 August 3147, Protector Sam Calderon and Kaff Doru announced that Doru's twelve-year-old daughter Reva and Calderon's eight-year-old son Bryant would marry once Bryant turned eighteen. Until then, the two nations would expand their trade relations and engage in mutual defense operations, with additional safeguards to prevent events like the Bromhead Massacre of 3067.",
