    "Description": "The Finmark Free Republic was a rising periphery power that became another casualty of the First Succession War.\r\n\r\nBetween 2779 and 2782 Finmark created a government modeled on the early Rim Worlds system and managed to pull together a defense force comprised largely of fresh recruits and orphaned elements of the SLDF and the former Rim Worlds Army; these forces mustered a strength of almost two BattleMech regiments, a similar number of aerospace fighters, and enough armor and infantry units for each world in the Republic to have approximately two regiments of mixed armor and infantry each.\r\n\r\nFinmark's influence continued to grow, with systems as far away as Inner Surge and Port Vail receiving some form of defensive support from Finmark by the late 2780s as the government worked on rebuilding as much of the former Finmark Province as possible; the government also worked to restore the orbital shipyards above Finmark, with the shipyards nearing fully operational status by the late 2780s. Unfortunately for the nascent interstellar state - and particularly the inhabitants of Finmark - the increasing savagery of the First Succession War combined with Finmark's growing strength attracted predatory attention from the Lyran Commonwealth.",

        "We both know the score, Commander. The Republic relies on you like you're one of our own, and you've always been happy to help us out. I hope you will agree to complete this contract as it is suitable to one of your stature."
