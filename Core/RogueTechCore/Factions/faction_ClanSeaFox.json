  "Description": "Clan Sea Fox is the original name of Clan Diamond Shark. Clan Sea Fox and Clan Snow Raven had a falling out, and in response Clan Snow Raven created the Diamond Shark, a predator designed solely to hunt and kill the Sea Foxes who lived in Strana Mechty's oceans. After most of the Sea Foxes had been killed, Clan Sea Fox petitioned the Grand Council to change its name to Clan Diamond Shark. Several sea foxes were preserved by the Clan and placed on other worlds, where they flourished. As a result, Clan Diamond Shark changed its name back to Clan Sea Fox by 3100. The Diamond Shark/Sea Fox Clan has relied heavily on its Merchant Caste since its inception, giving them more power and freedom than most Clans. Though many believe them to be weak because of their democratic attitudes toward their lower castes, the Diamond Sharks maintained one of the largest and most elite toumans among the Clans.",
