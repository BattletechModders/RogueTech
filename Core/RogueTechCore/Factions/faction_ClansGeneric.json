    "Description": "Founded 2807. The Clans are descended from the self-exiled remnants of the Star League Defense Force, who left the Inner Sphere following the collapse of the Star League. Upon reaching what is now known at the Pentagon Worlds, the SLDF fell to infighting, prompting Nicholas Kerensky, son of General Aleksandr Kerensky, to embark on a second exodus deeper into coreward space. Those who left with him were eventually reformed into the Clans, a strictly militant society who would go on to reconquer the Pentagon Worlds and later stage an invasion of the Inner Sphere.",
