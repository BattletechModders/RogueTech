  "ShortName": "Scorpion Empire",
  "Description": "The Scorpion Empire emerged from the remnants of Clan Goliath Scorpion and absorbed the assets of the shattered Clan Ice Hellion, establishing a new realm built on their shared histories and philosophies. Guided by the Scorpion Imperio, a unique governing body blending Clan traditions with the cultural influences of the Nueva Castile region, the Scorpion Empire seeks a balance between strength and cultural enrichment. Known for their esoteric outlook, the Empire reveres the mythical vision quests central to their Scorpion heritage while extending dominion across systems in the deep periphery.",
