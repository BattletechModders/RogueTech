    "GoodFaithFailureStatements": [
        "Most Clans would simply kill you for your failure to honor your batchall, but I realise I ask too much of a mere mercenary.  Perhaps this partial payment will encourage you to do better next time."

    "BadFaithFailureStatements": [
        "Clearly the concept of honour is lost to you.  If I had a Star available, I would kill you myself for your failure.  I suggest you leave before one <i>does</i> become available."

    "Description": "Clan Burrock is one of the original 20 Clans founded by Nicholas Kerensky, and is regarded as one of the more enlightened of the Crusader Clans as far as their treatment of commoners and freeborn."
