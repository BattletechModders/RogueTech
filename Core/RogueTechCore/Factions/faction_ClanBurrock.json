    "Your lack of honour is well known, so we offer this trivial task that is beneath even our solahma units, so you might begin to redeem yourself.",

    "We have met in combat before, and you have proved yourself moderately competent.  Perhaps you would like to prove yourself against one of our foes?",
    "You are an unknown to us.  Prove yourself on the field of battle with this batchall, and we may have further use of you.",
    "You have served us well enough in the past, and we would like to continue this relationship.  Perhaps this batchall will be to your liking?",
    "You fight with honour friend, and have shown yourself to be a capable warrior.  We have a task that we would normally not entrust to one such as you, but it is yours if you wish.",

    "Clearly the concept of honour is lost to you.  If I had a Star available, I would kill you myself for your failure.  I suggest you leave before one <i>does</i> become available."
