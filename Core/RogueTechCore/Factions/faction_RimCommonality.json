    "I don't know why we bother offering you contracts, to be perfectly honest. It's obvious you're not a friend to the Rim Commonality. Regardless, we find ourselves in desperate times, so we have to scrape the bottom of the barrel.",
    "Greetings, mercenary. Lowly and despicable though you may be, you may yet serve our interests. Finish this job, and we may look upon you with more favor than you likely deserve.",
    "The Rim Commonality has a use for mercenaries like you, Commander. I think you'll be interested in the attached contract. Hopefully we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",

    "Greetings, my friend. This contract is not one we would offer to a lesser mercenary, but you've proven your loyalty, prowess, and dedication to the ideals of the Rim Commonality. I hope you'll accept our offer.",
    "We both know the score, Commander. The Commonality relies on you like you're one of our own, and you've always been happy to help us out. I hope you can see fit to agree this time as well—this is a job too important for lesser warriors."
