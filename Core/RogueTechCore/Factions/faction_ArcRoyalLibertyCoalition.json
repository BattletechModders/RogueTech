  "Description": "The Arc-Royal Liberty Coalition (ARLC) is a breakaway state formed in the mid-32nd century after the collapse of the Wolf Empire and Clan Wolf's occupation of the Lyran Commonwealth's Arc-Royal region. Centered on the planet Arc-Royal, the ARLC was established under the leadership of Clan Wolf-in-Exile. It represents an alliance of local systems seeking autonomy, rejecting external domination while embracing both the Clan and Inner Sphere traditions. Known for its strong military capability, the Coalition is characterized by its hybrid culture and pragmatic governance, embodying a unique blend of freedom and security within a turbulent Inner Sphere.",
