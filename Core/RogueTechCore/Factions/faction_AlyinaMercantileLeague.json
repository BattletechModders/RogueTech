  "Description": "The Alyina Mercantile League is an independent state formed in the wake of Clan Jade Falcon's collapse during the mid-32nd century. Centered on the planet Alyina, the League emerged as a coalition of mercantile interests and planetary governments seeking to establish stability and economic independence in a region long ravaged by Clan conflict. Blending pragmatic governance with a strong focus on commerce, the League fosters cooperation among its member worlds while actively defending its sovereignty through a combination of mercenaries and local forces. Positioned at a crossroads of trade and strategy, the Alyina Mercantile League has become a beacon of order and prosperity in a fractious era.",
