    "Description": "Gutted in the fight for Terra and the proceeding ilKhan Trial, with 98% percent of their forces on Terra perishing in the struggles, Clan Jade Falcon's survivors numbered roughly 120, with many of those severely injured. Clan Jade Falcon then began serving as a bodyguard Clan vowing to protect the ilKhan and the reborn Star League under new leadership after abandoning the Mongol Doctrine and choosing a new Khan.  The most intact part of the Falcon's touman was their Warfleet, which helped Clan Wolf units to keep watch over the other Clans invited to the IlClan's founding ceremony.  The remaining forces in the Occupation Zone were either conquered by Inner Sphere factions or splintered into newer incarnations of the Clan. One maintains the Clan Jade Falcon identity and is led by Khan Jiyi Chistu, the other, composed by the bulk of the Falcon's Merchant Caste, is the Alyina Mercantile League, led by Merchant caste Syndic Marena.",
