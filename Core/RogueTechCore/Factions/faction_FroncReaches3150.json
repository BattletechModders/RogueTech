  "Description": "The Fronc Reaches is a small Periphery state located in the Capellan Marches rimward of the Capellan Confederation, spinward of the Magistracy of Canopus, and anti-spinward of the Taurian Concordat. The Fronc Reaches formed from worlds jointly colonized by the Magistracy of Canopus and the Taurian Concordat, formerly known as the New Colony Region. From 3135, trade negotiations were opened with both the Capellan Confederation and the Magistracy of Canopus, with both markets eager for military equipment manufactured by the Reaches.",
