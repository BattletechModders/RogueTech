  "Description": "The Galatean League emerged as a formal entity on December 24, 3144, following the successful defense of Galatea against an invasion by Clan Jade Falcon. Originally a loose coalition of mercenary commands led by Hansen's Roughriders, the League was established to safeguard Galatea and its neighboring worlds from future Clan advances. Envoys from the League extended invitations to Menkent, Mizar, and Syrma, securing the allegiance of Syrma and Mizar in 3145, though Menkent chose to align with the Jade Falcons. Alcor later joined the League as well. Despite Mizar's withdrawal in 3149, the League maintained a protective presence there, highlighting its commitment to regional stability. The Galatean League represents a bastion of independence and mercenary cooperation in the fractured Inner Sphere of the 32nd century.",
