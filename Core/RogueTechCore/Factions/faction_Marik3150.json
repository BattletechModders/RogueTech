  "Description": "The Free Worlds League is one of the five Successor States of the Star League, located rimward and anti-spinward of Terra. Ruled by House Marik, the League was, with the Capellan Confederation, one of the original signatories of the treaties that would eventually form the Star League. After the fall of the Star League, the Free Worlds League granted broad control over its economy and government to the commander of its military, the Captain-General. The League is known for being a powerful mercantile state, but the Succession Wars have nearly destroyed its economy. In 3148, the reborn League faced invasions from the Marian Hegemony, Regulan Fiefs, and Duchy of Andurien, managing to defeat them all and invade the Regulan Fiefs. The state surrendered to the Free Worlds League following an invasion that was sparked by the assassination of Jessica Marik. The Regulan Fiefs were granted provisional status within the League for a period of ten years, after which they would be allowed to request full membership.  The current ruler of the League is Captain-General Nikol Marik.",

    "I don't know why we bother offering you contracts, to be perfectly honest. It's obvious you're not a friend to the Free Worlds League. Regardless, we find ourselves in desperate times, so we have to scrape the bottom of the barrel.",
    "Greetings, mercenary. Lowly and despicable though you may be, you may yet serve our interests. Finish this job, and we may look upon you with more favor than you likely deserve.",
    "The Free Worlds League has a use for mercenaries like you, Commander. I think you'll be interested in the attached contract. Hopefully we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",
    "The Free Worlds League would like to offer you a choice contract, Commander. As the leader of a respected mercenary company, you should find the terms both fair and equitable, I think.",

    "Greetings, my friend. This contract is not one we would offer to a lesser mercenary, but you've proven your loyalty, prowess, and dedication to the ideals of the Free Worlds League. I hope you'll accept our offer.",
    "We both know the score, Commander. House Marik relies on you like you're one of our own, and you've always been happy to help us out. I hope you can see fit to agree this time as well—this is a job too important for lesser warriors."
