  "ShortName": "New Oberon",
  "Description": "The New Oberon Confederation emerged in 3086 following the withdrawal of Clan Hell's Horses from the Periphery. Centered on Oberon VI, the Confederation reestablished its independence under local administrators who took control after the Clan's departure. With assistance from Clan Ghost Bear technicians, they refurbished Grimfort — a fortress originally built by Hendrik Grimm — transforming it into a modern Castle Brian to bolster their defenses.",
