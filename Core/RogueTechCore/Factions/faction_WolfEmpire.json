  "Description": "The Wolf Empire, established on January 1, 3142, emerged from Clan Wolf's strategic expansion into the Inner Sphere during the tumultuous Blackout period. Under the leadership of Khan Alaric Ward, Clan Wolf seized over sixty worlds from the Free Worlds League and the Lyran Commonwealth, culminating in the proclamation of the Wolf Empire. With its capital on Gienah, the Empire continued its aggressive campaigns, ultimately breaching the Republic of the Sphere's defenses to capture Terra in 3151, thereby becoming the ilClan of the reborn Star League.
