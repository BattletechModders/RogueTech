    "Description": "The Ferris Collective is a small independent state located between the Rasalhague Dominion and the Republic of the Barrens. Established in the chaos following the collapse of the Hegemony, the Collective is governed by a self-appointed 'Emperor,' who oversees a patchwork of settlements and factories. Known for its pragmatic reliance on mercenary forces to secure its interests, the Ferris Collective is both a trading hub and a fiercely defended enclave, using its manufacturing capabilities and mercenary contracts to maintain independence in the turbulent 32nd century Inner Sphere.",
