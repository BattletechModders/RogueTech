  "Description": "The Timbuktu Collective is a protective alliance formed in June 3148 through the merger of the Rim Collection and five worlds from the Lyran Commonwealth's Timbuktu Theater. This union was driven by secessionist sentiments and a desire for greater autonomy amid perceived neglect by the Commonwealth. The Collective's capital is Timbuktu II, and as of 3151, it controlled 17 systems. Its military, the Collective Armed Guards (CAG), was initially formed from defected units and has since expanded through local enlistment and the hiring of mercenaries. The Collective has steadily expanded its borders, incorporating additional worlds such as Pocologan, Viborg, and Sapienza. Despite economic challenges due to reduced interstellar trade, the Timbuktu Collective remains determined to restore its former territories and industrial might.",
