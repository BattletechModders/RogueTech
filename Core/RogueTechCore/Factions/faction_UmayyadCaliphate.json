  "ShortName": "Caliphate",
  "Description": "The Umayyad Caliphate is a small state residing within the Deep Periphery. The Umayyads are in a region of space roughly seventy-five light years in diameter, situated 150 light years coreward from the Hanseatic League and 200 light years anti-spinward from the Clan Jade Falcon colony of St. Jean. Originally separate entities, more than 200 years of continuous warfare and shared history has inextricably bound the Umayyads to Nueva Castile, even resulting in the intermingling of some bloodlines.",
