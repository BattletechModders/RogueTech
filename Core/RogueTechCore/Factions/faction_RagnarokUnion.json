  "Description": "The Ragnarök Union is a microstate in the Barrens region, established in July 3084. It comprises three worlds—Götterdämmerung, Botany Bay, and Last Chance—which were formerly part of the Greater Valkyrate. Under the leadership of Hu Xiao Lin, who maintained her position since before the Clan Invasion, the Union achieved self-sufficiency by leveraging historical ties with Lackhove and Erewhon to access advanced technology. By 3095, the Union operated a cluster of tanks acquired from Clan Jade Falcon; however, efforts to secure training at the Falcon's military academy on Somerset had not yet succeeded.",
