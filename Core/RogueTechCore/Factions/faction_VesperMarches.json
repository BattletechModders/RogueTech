  "ShortName": "Vesper Marches",
  "Description": "The Vesper Marches is a nation established in March 3151 within the former Clan Jade Falcon Occupation Zone. Founded by Duke Vedet Brewer, the Marches emerged following Brewer's departure from the Lyran Commonwealth and his subsequent takeover of Melissia, which became the capital of his new realm. Initially, its military strength centered around the First Hesperus Guards, with later expansions incorporating noble personal armies. Politically, the Vesper Marches function as Brewer's personal domain, maintained through alliances with Melissia's noble families. Economically, the nation benefits from corporate support on Medellin and trade relations with the Free Guilds of the Malthus Confederation.",
