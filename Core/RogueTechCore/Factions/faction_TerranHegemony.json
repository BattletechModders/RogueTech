  "Description": "The Terran Hegemony was an interstellar state located at the center of the Inner Sphere. Established after a military coup led by James McKenna overthrew the dictatorial and decaying Terran Alliance, the Hegemony quickly rose to dominating positions in the realms of technology, military innovation, and diplomacy, and remained the most influential of all interstellar powers for the rest of its existence. The Hegemony's early expansionist period contributed to the formation of the Great Houses, its era of aggressive diplomacy eventually led to the creation of the Star League, and its destruction in the Amaris Civil War led to the Succession Wars.",

    "I don't know why we bother offering you contracts, to be perfectly honest. It's obvious you're not a friend to the Terran Hegemony. Regardless, we find ourselves in desperate times, so the dregs will have to suffice.",
    "Greetings, mercenary. Lowly and despicable though you may be, you may yet serve our interests. Finish this job, and we may change our mind.",
    "The Terran Hegemony has a use for mercenaries like you, Commander. I think you'll be interested in the attached contract. It would be advisable that we come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",
    "The Terran Hegemony would like to offer you a choice contract, Commander. As the leader of a respected mercenary company, you should find the terms acceptable.",
    "Commander, I hope this message finds you well. The people of the Terran Hegemony would like to extend a contract to you, as you have proven your worth. Please consider it carefully.",
    "Greetings, my friend. This contract is not one we would offer to a lesser mercenary, but you've proven your loyalty, prowess, and dedication to the ideals of the Terran Hegemony. I hope you'll accept our offer.",
    "We both know the score, Commander. The Hegemony relies on you like you're one of our own, and you've always been there to help us out. I hope you can see fit to agree this time as well — this is a job too important for lesser warriors."

  "BadFaithFailureStatements": [
    "Your performance was appalling, Commander. Your efforts on the battlefield were no better than a group of green cadets, and not indicative of the leader of a reknowned mercenary company."
