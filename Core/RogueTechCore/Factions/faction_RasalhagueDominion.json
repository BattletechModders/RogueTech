  "Description": "The Rasalhague Dominion is a unique hybrid political entity that emerged in the late 31st century from the unification of Clan Ghost Bear and the Free Rasalhague Republic. Combining the rigid structure and traditions of the Clans with the democratic ideals of the Republic, the Dominion has created a balanced and innovative society. Centered around Skandia and Alshain, it maintains strong military capabilities under the tenets of Clan Ghost Bear's warrior caste, while fostering economic growth and civilian governance through the influence of its Rasalhagian citizens. The Dominion is defined by its emphasis on cooperation and unity, ensuring its people thrive within a structure that respects both cultural heritage and martial strength.",
