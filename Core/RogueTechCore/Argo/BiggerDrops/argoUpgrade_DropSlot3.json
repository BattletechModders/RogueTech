    "Details": "There's more to dropping a lance of BattleMechs from orbit than strapping them to a wall, Commander. Several of the gyros and handling sensors around the ship are damaged or downright missing. If we try to insert the ship from orbit with all four 'Mech cradles occupied, using anything less than an absolutely perfectly balanced load could lead to a very real chance of losing the shuttle and all aboard. We'll need to replace and recalibrate those systems through some test drops before we can make full use of the new Leopard, Commander.",
