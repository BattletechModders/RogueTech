    "Details": "Automating the <i>Argo</i>'s internal storage is the future. One last upgrade to the storage cells would let us move to an automated drone inventory system with a few pressurized WorkMechs for special work. Depressurizing some of our inventory and making robots do the work will save us a lot of upkeep by letting us assign the labour and resources elsewhere",
