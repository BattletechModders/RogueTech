    "Details": "The <i>Argo</i> can, in a pinch, generate quite a bit more thrust than it first seemed. By repairing a number of drive subsystems meant to increase thrust efficiency, itâ€™s possible to get the <i>Argo</i> up to an uncomfortable 2 g of sustained thrust.",

  "AssignedCastDescription": "The <i>Argo</i>'s drive is <i>far</i> more powerful than I suspected. We may not ever bring it completely back online, but for now I can increase our thrust. While 2 g is not comfortable and the crew will complain, we'll cut our travel times significantly.",
