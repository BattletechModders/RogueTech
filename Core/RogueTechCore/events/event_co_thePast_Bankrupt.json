A middle-aged couple are desperately pleading with a banker, or perhaps a loan-shark. Whatever he is, he won't budge.\r\n\r\nYou flash back to a particular moment, years ago. Your parents are arguing with the debt collectors, pleading for more time. They would be dead by their own hands just two weeks later.",
