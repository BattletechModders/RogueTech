While I was there, I picked up some special synchronized tools I learned about. Finicky things, hard to keep aligned, and they need to be plugged into something like the <i>Argo</i> to really sing. I'd like to use them now, but the synchronization benefits will only last for so long. Afterward, they'll basically work like normal tools.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you say?
