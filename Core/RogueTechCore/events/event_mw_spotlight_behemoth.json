You wheel around to see a huge, hairy, leather-clad man bellowing in apparent fury at your group. \r\n\r\nAs you prepare for a brawl, Behemoth says, \"Hey, Commander, let me handle this.\" She's grinning. \"You can keep shopping if you want.\"\r\n\r\nYou step out of her way, but linger a moment.\r\n\r\nBehemoth takes a wide stance, raises her fists in the air, and roars back at the berserker down the street. His eyes bulge out and he changes position, leaning forward like he's about to charge, and roars again. In response, Behemoth drops low and roars at the heavens.\r\n\r\nWhatever is going on, she seems to have it well in hand.",
