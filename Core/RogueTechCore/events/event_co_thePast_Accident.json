    "Details": "While planetside with Darius, networking for more contracts, the two of you stop off in a tavern for a drink.\r\n\r\nWhen you see the painting hanging above the bar, the rest of the world suddenly goes still and out-of-focus. A majestic Blackjack BJ-1 gazes down at you, straddling the horizon, its twin autocannons smoking. There's no mistaking your family's ancestral crest on the chassis.\r\n\r\nThe last time you saw this work of art, it was at an auction, being sold to pay off your family's debts.",
