I'm gonna need a million C-bills.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, one question…\" Sumire arches a brow. \"<i>Why</i> do we need a bird that eats people?\"\r\n\r\n{TGT_MW.Callsign} grins. \"We need it only temporarily. It's for a local collector. He's got his own personal zoo and also happens to have a cache of slightly used mechs. He'll part with a Mech for the right incentive. All I need are some extra hands—[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] will do—and the funds to buy the bird. Then, I can trade it to this eccentric billionaire. You'll be getting a hell of a deal on a practically pristine Mech.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a bad idea, even by <i>our</i> standards.\" Sumire narrows her eyes. \"You're not taking this scheme seriously are you, Commander?\"",
