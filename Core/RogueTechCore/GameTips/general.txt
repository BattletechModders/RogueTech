Look for ways to make your units and company cheaper without losing much effectiveness.
Sometimes fancy tech is a lot of money for a small improvement.

Losing is fun!
Beware of the S.H.I.T.S. : Severe Hazardous Irritable Taco Syndrome
You will stop procrastinating. Later.
The key to negotiating with mercenaries is convincing them that the compromise they agreed on is no compromise at all.
Failure is always a possibility! RNGesus giveth, and RNGesus taketh away.
Pyrrhic victories are for idealists. You're a mercenary — if the repairs are going to cost more than you're getting paid, you should have left already.
The most important mantra you can learn: 'Guns off the field.' If you can remove a target do so. Ignore salvage. Ignore target priority. Make it gone.
It's not the chassis, but the components that separate a Light 'Mech from a walking coffin.
Just because you rolled out to the battlefield with your new shiny heavy 'Mech, don't get too cocky. A few light 'Mechs can still kick your ass.
Competent commanders give the humble Urbanmech the respect it deserves.
You are valuable and you matter.
In any field of scientific endeavour, anything that can go wrong, will.
If the possibility exists of several things going wrong, the one that will go wrong is the one that will do the most damage.
Everything will go wrong at one time. That time is always when you least expect it.
If nothing can go wrong, something will.
Nothing is as easy as it looks.
Everything takes longer than you think.
Left to themselves, things always go from bad to worse.
Nature always sides with the hidden flaw.
Given the most inappropriate time for something to go wrong, that's when it will occur.
Mother Nature is a bitch. The universe is not indifferent to intelligence, it is actively hostile to it.
If everything seems to be going well, you have obviously overlooked something.
If you ever feel like you are doing far too much work take a moment to inspect things. You may be doing it wrong.
In an instrument or device characterized by a number of plus-or-minus errors, the total error will be the sum of all the errors adding in the same direction.
All warranty and guarantee clauses become invalid upon payment of the final invoice.
When opportunity comes knocking, don't complain about the noise.
Some days you're the pigeon. Other days you're the statue. Today is more of a statue day.
Some humans would do anything to see if it was possible to do it. If you put a large switch in some cave somewhere, with a sign on it saying 'End-of-the-World Switch. PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH', the paint wouldn't even have time to dry.
It's not worth doing something unless someone, somewhere, would much rather you weren't doing it.
Real stupidity beats artificial intelligence every time.
The presence of those seeking the truth is infinitely to be preferred to the presence of those who think they've found it.
We who think we are about to die will laugh at anything.
Always be wary of any helpful item that weighs less than its operating manual.
The intelligence of that creature known as a crowd is the square root of the number of people in it.
Sometimes it's better to light a flamethrower than curse the darkness.
It is always useful to face an enemy who is prepared to die for his country. This means that both you and he have exactly the same aim in mind.
The consensus seemed to be that if really large numbers of men were sent to storm the mountain, then enough might survive the rocks to take the citadel. This is essentially the basis of all military thinking.
Sometimes crazy is the best way to go.
Wisdom comes from experience. Experience is often a result of lack of wisdom.
It's not worth doing something unless someone, somewhere, would much rather you weren't doing it.
Real stupidity beats artificial intelligence every time.
War. War never changes. Well, I mean, the weapons, tactics and strategies do, but the killing, the killing doesn't. Well, I guess there's a lot more killing. So I suppose war changes a lot, well this was a waste of time...
Monstrous size has no intrinsic merit.
Overconfidence is a slow, and insidious killer.
Glittering gold, trinkets and baubles, all paid for in blood.

Be wary - triumphant pride precipitates a dizzying fall...
Success so clearly in view... or is it merely a trick of the light?
Death waits for the slightest lapse in concentration.
Carelessness will find no clemency in this place!
There is no such thing as luck; there is only adequate or inadequate preparation to cope with a statistical universe.
Do not underestimate light targets in large groups.
The funny thing about routine missions, is that those are the ones where everything goes south.
Expectations are what get you killed faster than anything else. Plan for things to not go according to plan.
To be wise is to realize that you know almost nothing, and that what you do know may be false.
Complex does not mean competent, and the most damning fool of all is an educated fool.
Never make anything simple and efficient when a way can be found to make it complex and wonderful.
Never make anything complex and expensive when something simple and could cheap could do it well enough.
The totally convinced and the totally stupid have too much in common for the resemblance to be accidental.
Well-trained, well-equipped troops can stand up to many more times their lesser brethren than linear arithmetic would seem to indicate.
Our commander is a military historian, his knowledge of the Star League is not due to 'being old enough to remember it'.
Should you prefer a more direct approach to combat, try autocannons. Nothing says, "BEGONE!" louder than a roaring AC/20.
A solid punch will cause most MechWarriors to shit a brick.
Stop referring to the base security personnel and rookies as 'cannon fodder', 'D-Class', and/or 'redshirts'. This is negatively affecting morale.
Rookies are not to be called 'Tactical Ablative Armor'. Calling them 'Taa-taas' is also frowned upon, whether they know the meaning of the acronym or not.

In any given calculation, the fault will never be placed if more than one person is involved. In any given discovery, the credit will never be properly placed if more than one person is involved.

The most important rule of combat - "have fun!"
Career Tip #1: Upgrade the Argo! Upgrades can raise your MedTech and MechTech ratings, as well as unlock new paths for events.
Career Tip #2: A fully upgraded Argo can support up to three Mech Bays working simultaneously.
Career Tip #3: Without upgrades, the Leopard can drop up to 4 Units, +2 tanks and +2 Battle Armor. Argo upgrades can increase both drop capacity and the maximum drop tonnage.
Career Tip #4: Mechjocks have a tough life. Argo upgrades can raise the Morale of your pilots, increasing their Resolve generation in combat, and unlocking new paths for events.
Career Tip #5: Upgrading the training module will help your MechWarriors get experience even if they are out of combat. Who thought playing video games can actually help you in the long run?
Career Tip #6: Money is the enabler. Without money, there is no company or a chance to rebuild and experiment on 'Mechs.
Career Tip #7: Always keep an eye on your expenses. If you overspend, don't be surprised if you can't afford the next electricity bill.
Career Tip #8: Manage your resources. Keeping your company in the black AND your 'Mechs functioning are equally important.
Career Tip #9: Restoring a salvaged 'Mech is a significant undertaking. Make sure your company is economically stable before you commit to expanding your roster.
Career Tip #10: Keep on top of your parts storage. 'Mech parts cost c-bills to store based on the tonnage of the 'Mech they're a part of. Selling 'Mech parts is a great way to cut costs AND generate extra cash quick.
Career Tip #11: Equipment costs c-bills to store based on how many critical slots it takes up. Keep on top of your storage costs by selling excess gear you don't need for spares.
Career Tip #12: Monthly expenses are halved when you accept a Priority Contract that requires travel.
Career Tip #13: Choose your contracts carefully, and you can get yourself some great salvage!
Career Tip #14: If you ever want to progress, you may need to punch above your lance's weight!
Career Tip #15: Talk to Sumire in Navigation to arrange Aerospace Fighter cover for the Leopard. Fighters can cover the Leopard during withdrawals and reduce the time it takes for extraction to arrive.
Career Tip #16: There are rumours that worlds emphasizing 'research' are developing advanced BattleMechs. It would be a shame if a prototype fell into the wrong hands.
Career Tip #17: Multiple types of deployable UAV can be purchased in some planet stores. Some of these variants come with powerful Electronic Warfare (EWAR) systems.
Career Tip #18: Most shops carry Battle Armor weapons, check back regularly to equip your troops!
Combat Tip #1: Positioning is key. High elevation gives bonus accuracy against enemy units, but be careful of exposing your unit to the whole enemy force.
Combat Tip #2: Any shot not taken is a miss. Just ask if it's worth the heat.
Combat Tip #3: A Gausszilla is only as dangerous as the local geography is flat. Careful positioning defeats mad courage every time.
Combat Tip #4: Be careful about hugging enemies, or you just might end up shooting your own units in the back. Or your allies might do it for you.
Combat Tip #5: Stray shots are just as deadly as well aimed ones. Even if a shot doesn't hit its target, it may hit a unit nearby. This goes both ways.
Combat Tip #6: Friendly fire isn't.
Combat Tip #7: Double check before you fire. There might be something in front or behind your target that you really do not want to hit.
Combat Tip #8: The colored dots on the ground show different types of terrain — for example, green dots represent damage-reducing cover such as forests or rubble.
Combat Tip #9: Weapons fire can damage terrain — forests can burn away and buildings can be destroyed.
Combat Tip #10: Buildings burn well. Buildings burn very well.
Combat Tip #11: Trees are decent ablative armor, until they get set on fire.
Combat Tip #12: After a forest tile has been burned, it offers no cover and negatively affects the stability of 'Mechs standing in it.
Combat Tip #13: 'Mechs standing in rubble or rough ground take additional stability damage.
Combat Tip #14: Dealing enough stability damage causes a 'Mech to become Unsteady, which removes all Evasion AND Guarded! Perfect for a follow up volley.
Combat Tip #15: Units retain their evasion when being shot at. Remove evasion from units by making them Unsteady through stability damage, or via the "Sensor Lock" pilot skill.
Combat Tip #16: A 'Mech must first become Unsteady before it can fall prone, unless a leg is destroyed.
Combat Tip #17: A prone 'Mech is harder to hit unless the attacker is directly adjacent.
Combat Tip #18: A 'Mech that stands from being prone takes a significant accuracy penalty for that turn.
Combat Tip #19: Watch your heat. Riding the red line will slow you down or blow you sky-high.
Combat Tip #20: Riding the red line is dangerous, but oh-so-fun.
Combat Tip #21: Hitting an already overheated enemy with flamers or heat-generating weapons gives bonus damage!
Combat Tip #22: Vehicles, turrets, and buildings convert incoming heat damage into regular damage at a 1:1 ratio.
Combat Tip #23: Overheating 'Mechs suffer from accuracy and movement penalties that increase with the level of heat. At high heat, 'Mechs may shut down, or ammunition bins may explode!
Combat Tip #24: Called Shots can be made for free against prone or shutdown targets.
Combat Tip #25: Multi-Target cannot select units equipped with any form of Stealth Armor.
Combat Tip #26: Offensive Push allows you to spend Resolve to make a Called Shot at any time.
Combat Tip #27: Offensive Push requires you to have vision of your target. Remember that darkness and forests can reduce visual range.
Combat Tip #28: Headshots are disabled in Offensive Push, unless your unit is equipped with "BC Headshot," or "FCS Headshot."
Combat Tip #29: Most Armored Fighting Vehicles (AFVs) have heavily armored fronts, but weaker sides and rear.
Combat Tip #30: Vehicles designated as weapon carriers, such as LRM Carriers normally have low durability, but high firepower. Prioritize and destroy.
Combat Tip #31: Vehicle pilots are most likely to die if the Front is destroyed. In a dire situation show your tank's side or rear if you value the pilot.
Combat Tip #32: Weapons have their Through-Armor-Critical (TAC) values doubled when striking vehicles.
Combat Tip #33: Through-Armor-Critical (TAC) chance is influenced by weapon type; a Gauss slug has a high penetration rate, but a Laser only melts the surface.
Combat Tip #34: High mobility units makes it easier to play objectives, rather than slugging it out with every enemy on the field.
Combat Tip #35: Light, fast units make effective flankers and spotters and may retreat to tie up your back line if left unchecked.
Combat Tip #36: Holding your cursor over the hit chance percentage in a unit's weapons tray will give a detailed breakdown of accuracy modifiers. This can tell you why one unit may be harder to hit than another.
Combat Tip #37: 60% of hits on a vehicle's armor will be on the facing toward the attacker.
Combat Tip #38: Hitting a unit with Target Acquisition Gear (TAG) makes the unit easier to see and detect on sensors. It also grants bonus accuracy against the tagged unit.
Combat Tip #39: 90% to hit is still 10% to miss. Dice don't follow your expectations.
Combat Tip #40: Generous use of Thunder LRMs or other mine-laying ammunition can destroy lighter 'Mechs before they get close by removing their legs.
Combat Tip #41: Switch between your equipped ammunition types by clicking on the name of your current ammunition in the 'Mech's weapon panel.
Combat Tip #42: When a PPC-type weapon hits the ground, it clears nearby landmines. You can do this intentionally with the "Attack Ground" ability!
Combat Tip #43: High-explosive munitions can clear nearby landmines! Check the tooltip of ammo or weapons to see if this applies to them.
Combat Tip #44: Burning terrain has a chance to destroy landmines within, unless they are inferno landmines.
Combat Tip #45: Some Battle Armor can make Swarm Attacks. These special melee attacks 'stick' the Battle Armor to the unit. Use the "Swat" ability to brush them off, or use "Erratic Maneuvers" and move as far as you can!
Combat Tip #46: Battle Armor inside the bay of a vehicle have a 33% chance of being destroyed along with the vehicle if the vehicle takes lethal damage.
Combat Tip #47: Machine Guns, Flamers and Small Pulse lasers gain bonus accuracy and damage vs Battle Armor Squads.
Combat Tip #48: Untrained MechWarriors are more likely to panic. Punch through their armor to make them reach for that eject button.
Combat Tip #49: Scare your enemy into bailing out! Destroying their allies, flanking, and reducing their offensive capability all lead to panic.
Combat Tip #50: Panicked pilots will calm over time if not under fire. A high Guts skill reduces panic rate.
Combat Tip #51: Wounded pilots will start to panic as their bleed-out timer gets low.
Combat Tip #52: A wounded pilot can administer emergency first aid. It won't remove the bleeding, but it might keep them alive long enough to extract!
Combat Tip #53: First Aid not only delays bleed-out for a turn, it gives the pilot a bonus to their next Panic check.
Combat Tip #54: The weapons panel can scroll up and down to display a large number of items and activatable equipment.
Combat Tip #55: Holding your cursor over the cyber-eye icon in your unit's status tray, above the armor display, will allow you to see their sensor rolls and bonuses for the turn.
Combat Tip #56: Holding your cursor over the ECM Suite icon in your unit's status tray, above the armor display, will allow you to see all Electronic Warfare (EWAR) bonuses currently affecting them.
Combat Tip #57: Holding your cursor over the ECM Suite icon in an enemy unit's status tray, below their armor display, will allow you to see all Electronic Warfare (EWAR) bonuses currently affecting them.
Combat Tip #58: Holding your cursor over the weather icon in your unit's status tray, above the armor display, will allow you to see the effects of the weather on the field.
Combat Tip #59: Weather conditions can affect sight and sensor ranges.
Combat Tip #60: Some VTOL carry powerful bombs, watch out for the big ones!
Combat Tip #61: Killing Rocket Launcher units before they blow their load is tactically advisable.
Combat Tip #62: Many missions have lances designated as reinforcements. Your deployments may not always be a milk run.
Combat Tip #63: Losing your ranged weapons does not mean the battle is lost. It just means that the battle is about to get less civilized.
Combat Tip #64: A 'Mech splits its melee damage across the number of hits it makes — a 'Mech with two hands making a 30-damage punch attack hits twice for 15 damage.
Combat Tip #65: Enemy airstrikes can be nullified by strong anti-air (AA) presence. Units can enter "AA Stance" to contribute the AA Factor of their weapons to a total chance of preventing an airstrike.
Combat Tip #66: If you are in a tight spot you can try to wrap up the mission by completing only the main objective then escaping. If it isn't possible, sometimes withdrawing in bad faith is better than losing your lance completely.
Combat Tip #67: Firing weapons makes a unit twice as easy to detect. If you want to hide a unit move it out of sight and don't fire.
Combat Tip #68: A unit carrying a Command Console, Communications Gear, or C3 equipment can buff all units on its team. Identify and eliminate enemy Command 'Mechs to gain the upper hand!
Combat Tip #69: Nice.
Combat Tip #70: A trained sniper not only has deadly weapons, but keen eyesight. Same applies to 'Mechs. Have a scout to see where to shoot.
Combat Tip #71: Always keep an eye on the weaponry the enemy has. High sensor rolls will let you know if that UrbanMech is carrying a party horn or an AC/20.
Combat Tip #72: Gunnery Skill reduces Jam/Misfire chance by a flat 1 percentage point per point. Other methods are multipliers.
Combat Tip #73: You can't prioritize targets until you know what's out there. Scout early. Scout often.
Combat Tip #74: Scouting only matters if you can actually recognize threats when you see them. Get better sensors and increase your 'mech knowledge.
Combat Tip #75: Attacks against a 'mech from the front or rear spread the damage around the most.
Combat Tip #76: Attacking a 'mech from the flank can hit anywhere, but focus damage on one side's arm, side torso and leg.
Combat Hotkeys #1: TAB can be used to cycle between valid targets.
Combat Hotkeys #2: Press V to cycle between valid melee targets.
Combat Hotkeys #3: Pressing CTRL+T will enable or disable the coloured attack direction indicators.
Combat Hotkeys #4: When using "Attack Ground," holding Left ALT will allow you to target friendly units and structures.
Combat Hotkeys #5: Press CTRL+A to toggle the visibility of aura effects, such as Electronic Warfare (EWAR) equipment.
Combat Hotkeys #6: Hold SHIFT when deploying a UAV to select which type is deployed from the Argo's inventory.
Combat Hotkeys #7: Clicking on an objective in the list focuses the camera on related units or locations.
Combat Hotkeys #8: Hold shift while clicking reserve to reserve all remaining units down to phase 1.
Deployment Tip #1: Clicking on a unit in a deployment slot will order the list of pilots by affinity with that unit from highest to lowest.
Deployment Tip #2: Plan your lance according to the range & strategy you intend to use.
Deployment Tip #3: Dropping a lance that has a higher rating than the mission rating has a chance to generate additional reinforcements, called "Support Lances". The greater the difference in rating; the higher the chance.
EWAR Tip #1: EWAR stands for "Electronic Warfare," which covers a wide range of equipment used to disrupt the enemy's attempts to target your units.
EWAR Tip #2: Electronic Warfare (EWAR) equipment such as ECM Suites can provide significant benefits to your lance. Read the tooltips of your equipment to see their effects!
EWAR Tip #3: ECM stands for "Electronic Countermeasures."
EWAR Tip #4: ECM Suites can be set to Passive or Active modes. Passive mode focuses on protecting the carrier and makes them harder to hit. Active mode focuses on jamming nearby enemies and reducing their accuracy, as well as reducing jamming on nearby allies.
EWAR Tip #5: BAP stands for "Beagle Active Probe," but is commonly use to describe other types of Active Probe.
EWAR Tip #6: Active Probes boost a unit's sensor check, improving the information gathered about enemies at longer ranges.
EWAR Tip #7: Stealth Armors require a dedicated ECM Suite, such as a Guardian ECM, or an AR24 Sheathed Beacon. An item's tooltip will inform whether it fulfils the requirements for Stealth Armor.
EWAR Tip #8: Sensor Stealth makes a unit harder to detect on sensors and provides defensive bonuses which increase with distance to target.
EWAR Tip #9: Mimetic Stealth makes a unit much harder to see, but loses effectiveness based on how far the stealthed unit has moved that turn.
EWAR Tip #10: Stealth Armors might make you feel like a ninja, but they lack the damage reduction of other advanced armor types. Be careful not to tempt fate.
EWAR Tip #11: A Narc Pod attached to a unit makes that unit easier to see and detect on sensors. It also cuts through one level of ECM Shielding, Sensor Stealth, and Mimetic Stealth.
EWAR Tip #12: IFF Jammers are specialist equipment which provide a low-level ECM Shield to the carrier. This stacks with other sources of ECM Shield.
Mech Bay Tip #1: If a 'Mech's loadout is invalid, you can hit the "Confirm" button to see what issues it has.
Mech Bay Tip #2: Items have important information listed in brightly coloured text in their tooltips.
Mech Bay Tip #3: Basic components that come with a 'Mech like the default cockpit and gyro are easy to come by and replace. Don't worry if they blow up! They'll be replaced when the 'Mech is repaired.
Mech Bay Tip #4: A 'Mech needs an engine core to function. Engine core rating dictates how fast a 'Mech can move and typically sets your tonnage budget for the remaining equipment and armor.
Mech Bay Tip #5: In RogueTech, engine cores can be hotswapped. You don't need to hunt specifically for a VLAR 200 XL Engine.
Mech Bay Tip #6: Sometimes a bigger or smaller core is better for your 'Mech. Don't be afraid to experiment and see what works for you.
Mech Bay Tip #7: Clan Extralight (XL) Fusion Engines, and Light Fusion Engines take up two critical slots in each side torso. Losing a single side torso will heavily damage the engine; losing both side torsos will destroy it.
Mech Bay Tip #8: Extralight (XL) Fusion Engines take up three critical slots in each side torso. Losing the torso will cause the engine to be destroyed.
Mech Bay Tip #9: Engine cores have a chance to go critical when destroyed. Modern engines (Fusion, XL, etc.) have a lower chance to explode than Primitive engines.
Mech Bay Tip #10: Heat Sink types cannot be mixed; a 'Mech with a Double Heat Sink (DHS) kit cannot use single Heat Sinks.
Mech Bay Tip #11: Double Heat Sinks (DHS) require a DHS Kit, which can be installed in the cooling slot.
Mech Bay Tip #12: Equipment is key. A well-equipped Light can kill a poorly equipped Assault.
Mech Bay Tip #13: C.A.S.E. prevents damage from internal explosions from travelling towards the Center Torso. Like fire extinguishers and condoms, it's better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it.
Mech Bay Tip #14: C.A.S.E protects a location from all internal explosions, including volatile weapons and equipment, in addition to ammo explosions.
Mech Bay Tip #15: C.A.S.E II prevents the majority of damage from an internal explosion by venting the force out the back of the 'Mech. This can save the location, but strips the rear armor!
Mech Bay Tip #16: Clan armor types have C.A.S.E incorporated into every location, though it is less effective than the standalone version.
Mech Bay Tip #17: C.A.S.E. PROTECTS! C.A.S.E. IS LIFE!
Mech Bay Tip #18: The repair costs of armor can vary depending on the type of armor and your company's MechTech rating.
Mech Bay Tip #19: Armor type matters! Primitive armor is cheap and easy to maintain, but provides less armor per ton. Hardened armor is expensive and heavy, but offers superior protection.
Mech Bay Tip #20: Ammo explodes. Don't have too much of it. Also, don't run out of ammo. But you do you, chief.
Mech Bay Tip #21: Every weapon has an AA Factor, which informs how much it contributes to preventing an airstrike. Equipping a 'Mech with multiple high AA Factor weapons can make it an effective deterrent for enemy airstrikes.
Mech Bay Tip #22: Pulse Lasers and Streak Missiles allow a 'Mech to ignore a number of Evasive pips on the target, making them ideal for hunting down fast moving units.
Mech Bay Tip #23: Railguns and Gauss rifles deal tremendous damage at equally tremendous ranges. Reach out and touch someone.
Mech Bay Tip #24: Ultra Autocannons (UACs), Rotary Autocannons (RACs) and LB-X Autocannons all benefit from Autocannon-specific equipment, such as "FCS AC." Most artillery pieces do, too!
Mech Bay Tip #25: ER PPC stands for "Extended-Range Particle Projector Cannon." These weapons have huge range and high damage, but generate a lot of heat.
Mech Bay Tip #26: Equip your 'Mechs with specialized melee actuators to massively increase their effectiveness in close quarters.
Mech Bay Tip #27: Anti-Missile Systems (AMS) will intercept missiles fired at the 'Mech using them. Advanced models even intercept enemy missiles in a radius around the 'Mech.
Mech Bay Tip #28: Extended-Range (ER) Lasers have much longer range than their standard counterparts, but build up significantly more heat!
Mech Bay Tip #29: Big weapons are scary, but if you can't land shots, they won't do any good! Try using many smaller weapons instead to increase your effectiveness with more inexperienced pilots.
Mech Bay Tip #30: Quantity over quality! Being able to fire multiple medium lasers with proper heat management will be worth more than that single large laser that might not even hit.
Mech Bay Tip #31: Stack the odds in your favor! Take precision or Artemis ammunition, and equip targeting computers or TAGs to drastically increase your chance to hit!
Mech Bay Tip #32: Those without the resources or money for proper BattleMechs may field Agro or IndustrialMechs! Even these unassuming 'Mechs can be dangerous in the right hands!
Mech Bay Tip #33: Vehicles can't be optimized like 'Mechs, but they often have good firepower relative to their tiny effect on your lance rating and costs.
Mech Bay Tip #34: Many weapons and some equipment have alternative ammunition types. Experiment with different ammo bins for different scenarios!
Mech Bay Tip #35: Handheld weapons block other weapons in that arm from firing until they are dropped.
Mech Bay Tip #36: Vehicles carry as much armor as 'Mechs, but spread over fewer locations, making each individual location tougher. However, vehicles are destroyed as soon as any location reaches zero structure.
Mech Bay Tip #37: Don't have too many weapons, else your mobility may suffer.  However, dont have too few weapons either, but you do you, Boss.
Mech Bay Tip #38: Clan equipment is generally lighter, or more powerful than it's Inner Sphere equivalents, but it runs hotter too.
Mech Bay Tip #39: A C3 network requires a C3 Master to work, or a command module with C3 Master capabilities. C3i networks do not.
Mech Bay Tip #40: Parts of Omnimechs are generally more valuable than Battlemechs due to in-built engines and gear.
Mech Bay Tip #41: Beacon items don't need to be equiped on the unit with the Deploy item to be used.
Mech Bay Hotkeys #1: CTRL+Click on the "Strip Equipment" button to only remove weapons and ammo.

Movement Tip #1: It's hard to aim on the move! Movement applies an accuracy penalty to your pilots, based on what kind of movement used. The penalty for walking is lowest, followed by sprinting, and then jumping.
Movement Tip #2: Terrain types can influence a unit's walking or sprinting speed - roads make most units move faster, while forests or water can slow units down.
