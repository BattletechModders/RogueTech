    "Details": "While in orbit around [[TGT_SYSTEM,{TGT_SYSTEM.Name}]] Darius grabs your attention, \"Commander, we have an incoming transmission from <i>Riveting Enterprises</i> responding to our enquiry about replacing our faulty door bolts.\"\r\n\r\nYou nod to Darius to open the channel on the holoviewer,\"This is Commander {COMMANDER.LastName} of the <i>Argo</i>.\"\r\n\r\nAs the hologram visage sharpens, you are greeted by the face of an obvious sales rep, \"Greetings Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}.  I am Boltan Hatcher and I hear you are in need of some orbital repairs.  According to our records, the <i>Argo</i> is a <i>Boeing Interstellar</i> dropship.\"  He chuckles to himself before continuing, \"Please excuse me... it is honestly surprising that your ship is still spaceworthy, considering it's lineage.\"\r\n\r\nTiring of the banter, you get to the point, \"Can you assist us or not, Mr Hatcher?  And how much will this cost?\"\r\n\r\nMr Hatcher smiles back at you, \"Direct and to the point.  I can respect that.  Seeing as my employer, <i>Riveting Enterprises</i>, a supplier of materials for <i>Jalastar Aerospace</i>, harbours no good will towards <i>Boeing Interstellar</i>, we would like to quote you the reduced price of only ¢5,000,000.  Normally, a project of this magnitude would be three times that amount, but, it will feel all that sweeter to <i>'fix'</i> a fault-ridden dropship manufactured by a competitor.  Now, before you go trying to wheedle the price down even further, know this, we will expedite your repairs first and foremost over all our other current work orders and have you safely on your way in record time.  This is our one and only offer, Commander, so please, think wisely.\"",
