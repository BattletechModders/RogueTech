    "Details": "Samuel Dannen was a smart, but troublesome child who devoured books and holovids about legendary MechWarriors.\r\n\r\nBorn on Kittery, he watched the 1st Kittery Borderers exercises near the garrison as he grew up. Too poor to enter the local military academies, he spent years as a civilian, drifting between dead end jobs until he earned a position as a mechanic at the garrison. Some nights after repairing the 'Mechs, he would sneak back in. He spent these nights learning the complicated controls inside each 'Mech. That is until he was discovered one night and fired. No charges were pressed, but the head mechanic couldn't afford to keep him on any longer.",
