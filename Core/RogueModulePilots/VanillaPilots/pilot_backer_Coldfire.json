    "Details": "Hadden Cornichon, later known as Coldfire, was born in the Brixtana system of the Magistracy of Canopus. He grew up on the back stage of a traveling pleasure circus as part of an extended family responsible for the circus's pyrotechnic displays. While he shared his family's love for explosions, he quickly became bored with the limited creativity of the circus's well-defined show. As soon as he could talk his family into it, he and two of his cousins were traded to a new circus looking to start up its own pyrotechnics show in exchange for an apprentice dancer. The new circus focused on dramatic reenactments of historical battles—complete with BattleMech shells that required his expertise to look and sound real.\r\n\r\nBarely two years after joining his new circus, he started knocking at the doors of the Magistracy Armed Forces, hoping to join the Magistracy Royal Guard as a MechWarrior. Since his education up until that point had been very spotty, he was repeatedly turned away in favor of more traditional candidates. But the young Coldfire knew nothing could be better than piloting a 'Mech into battle, so he buckled down and learned just enough to pass the entry exams imposed by the MAF. They gave him the training he wanted, but not the battles. As soon as his contract expired, he abandoned the peace-loving Magistracy for a place where a MechWarrior could always find work: the unclaimed, lawless systems of the Rimward Periphery.\r\n\r\nAs a pilot, Coldfire is loud, jovial, and always up for the highest-risk missions—even if the likelihood of getting paid is low. Helping others is in his blood, he claims, and if he can have a good time while doing it, even better! He loves pushing the biggest 'Mechs to their highest speeds and relishes a well-executed Death From Above. Outside of battle, he's rambunctious but usually stops short of causing real trouble to his COs. And if you ever need a pyrotechnics display, he's your man.",
