    "Details": "Grampa Checkers is an old damn man. Even in the Inner Sphere, where age is less of an impediment for mechwarriors due to advanced medical proceedures and prosthetics, Grampa is very old to be a pilot. He didn't age gracefully either, often going off on random tangents and falling down a lot. Still, when you get him on-topic (and on-target) he proves to still be a crack shot in the cockpit. But you still have to deal with him on comms, which might not be worth it. Your call, Commander.",
