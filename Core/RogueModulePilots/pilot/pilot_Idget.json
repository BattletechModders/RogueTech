    "Details": "Idget was once a tech, solving issues (called 'tickets' in the jargon) that cropped up at work.  After a pirate raid which saw massive casualties, the volume of tickets dropped significantly. Seeing such effective ticket-closing action, Idget quickly trained as a MechWarrior, promising to help solve tickets everywhere, one way or another. Working for mercenaries all over, Idget started to receive a reputation of being the best anti-urban-ambush pilot around, due to the methodical way in which buildings were leveled in the area of operations. They say that if you're lucky enough, when the tickets become too deep, Idget will come and save you.",
