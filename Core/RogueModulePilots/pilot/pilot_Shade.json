While growing up on Smithon, within Aurigan space, offered the Volkov family a fraction of safety and peace compared to many other periphery states, Carson certainly put his luck to the test as he served in infantry and armored divisions for several years. Eventually, he took a discarded Icarus II chassis and found his way into the local gladiatorial circuit and from there, became a Merc.",
