    "Details": "Yeah, but imagine that's you: \r\n\r\nYou'd get your first look at the 30-ton Trash Can as you move into an intersection. But the Urbie, he knew you were there a long time ago. He moves like a heavy mech: stompy, bobbing his head. And you keep still because you think, maybe, with his cheap Periphery Radar he'll lose you if you don't move. But, no. Not the UrbanMech. You stare at him, and he just stares back. That's when the attack comes - not from the front, no - from the side. From the other two Urbies you didn't even know were there. \r\n\r\nUrbanMechs are a pack-hunter, you see, he uses coordinated attack patterns and he's out in force today. And he fires at you with an Imperator AC, a 12-ton Anti-Mech weapon, like a sledgehammer, on the right arm. They don't bother to go for the cockpit, like a Hunchback; they just shoot here - in the center torso, and here in the leg. Or, maybe, across the gyro, spilling you across the tarmac. \r\n\r\nPoint is: you're alive when they start to eat you.",
