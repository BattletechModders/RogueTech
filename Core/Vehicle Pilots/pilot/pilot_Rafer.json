    "Details": "Rafer is a driver. He's a very good driver. On his home planet, it is a custom to have to drive around for a year at a minimum of 50 miles an hour in a vehicle. If the speed ever drops below that, the vehicle explodes. This leaves Rafer with a lot of experience, a lot of regret. Lost hopes and dreams. Before the race, he rode around for fun. Now, even after leaving his planet and searching for his destiny among the stars, he must drive. Drive to survive.",
