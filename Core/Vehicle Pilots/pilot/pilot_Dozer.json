    "Details": "When you live on a rock in Aurigan space, life is not exciting. Then, one day, a whole war over who is in control changed that. One day, he was driving a heavy dozer, clearing ground, the next he was driving a tank, clearing enemies. Being in the military after your side loses a war isn't much use though, so once the fighting was done, he put his talents up for sale. He barely remembers his civilian life any more, but he still holds the nickname 'Dozer'.",
