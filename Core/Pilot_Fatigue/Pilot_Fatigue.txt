Pilot Fatigue:

Now after every mission your pilots that participated are now fatigued. They are out for the following time (default values used): 

	-Time Out = 7 - Guts/2 - Morale threshold
	-Morale threshold: +-1 for +-5 morale from Starting Morale Value, +-2 for +-15 from start
	-1 point piloting, tactics, and gunnery lost for every 2 days of fatigue, rounded up.
	-Chance to resist a light injury = guts * 10%


Once Fatigued, this pilot can still be used during this period. However, if they are used they will have the possibility of suffering on "Light Injury." This converts their Fatigue time directly to injury time. They have a chance to resist this based upon their Guts Value (10% x Guts Value).

Values that can be changed in the settings.json:

	"FatigueTimeStart" : 7, (How many days to start the fatigue calculation at)
	"StartingMorale" : 25, (enter starting morale here for MoraleTier determinations)
	"FatigueMinimum" : 0, (minimum days that a pilot will be fatigued for after a mission)
	"MoralePositiveTierOne" : 5, (Positive difference from StartingMorale to reduce fatigue by 1 day)
	"MoralePostiveTierTwo" : 15, (Positive difference from StartingMorale to reduce fatigue by 2 day)
	"MoraleNegativeTierOne" : -5, (Negative difference from StartingMorale to increase fatigue by 1 day)
	"MoraleNegativeTierTwo" : -15, (Negative difference from StartingMorale to increase fatigue by 2 day)
	"FatigueFactor" : 2.5, (For skill degradation with fatigue, how many days is used in the calculation)
	"InjuriesHurt" : true, (makes your skills degrade one point per pilot injury)
