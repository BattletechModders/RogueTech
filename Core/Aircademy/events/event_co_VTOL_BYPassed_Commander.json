All the paperwork certifying that you are fully qualified to pilot a VTOL has come in.  Apparently a misrouted HPG message caused the delay in notifying us.  The details are all there.\"",

As a paying customer, I expected a level of professionalism and competence that was sorely lacking in my recent experience.\r\n\r\nMy frustration stems from the fact that the LAM pilot training program I was enrolled in failed to deliver on its promises. My company invested significant resources into sending me to your facility with the expectation that I would return with the necessary certification to operate Land-Air-Mechs proficiently. However, much to my dismay, I was not provided with a training certificate upon completion of the program.\r\n\r\nThis oversight is not only inconvenient but also potentially damaging to me and and the reputation of my company. Without the proper certification, we are unable to prove any competence as a LAM pilot, which could hinder my company's ability to secure future contracts with the MRBC. Furthermore, it reflects poorly on your company's credibility and integrity.\r\n\r\nI find it unacceptable that Air Today, Gone Tomorrow, a purported leader in LAM training, would fail to fulfill such a basic aspect of its service. It is evident that there was a significant lapse in communication and oversight within your organization, and I expect prompt action to rectify this situation.\r\n\r\nI expect a formal apology and compensation for the inconvenience and frustration caused by this egregious error. Furthermore, I urge you to review and improve your internal processes to ensure that such mistakes are not repeated in the future.\r\n\r\nFailure to address this matter satisfactorily will force me to escalate my concerns through other channels, including legal action with the MRBC if necessary. I trust that you will take this matter seriously and prioritize resolving it expediently.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{COMMANDER.LastName}\r\n\r\n{COMPANY.CompanyName}\r\n\r\nHPG ROUTING NUMBER: 000000 FF0000 000080</i></color>\r\n\r\nA broad smile crosses your face as you hit SEND"
