The King's Horses

Boss Fight

Fight a Custom Overlord Dropship and its BattleMech ground forces.
This Overlord has been refit to carry out extended planetary support operations. It has been outfitted with specialized weaponry, extra reserves of ammunition, as well as plenty of cargo space at the cost of how many 'Mechs and AeroSpace Fighters it can carry.

A standard Overlord Dropship is no easy target, and this one is meaner and nastier. Prepare to be Rogueteched.

Contract has restrictions:
Minimum missions required to have this contract spawn
Cooldown between possible spawning of the contract
