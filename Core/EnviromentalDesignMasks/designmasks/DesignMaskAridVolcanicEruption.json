    "Details": "This planet is experiencing a volcanic eruption near the OZ, which is causing a wide variety of issues. First, the volcanic ash obscures vision and sensor range by 35%. Additionally, the ash is also super-heated and generates 10 bonus heat on all units per turn as well as reducing heat sinking by 35%. Finally, the ash clouds targeting systems, inflicting a +2 accuracy penalty on all attacks.",
