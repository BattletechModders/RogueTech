    "Details": "The Nano-Fluid Damper is still in prototype stage, but could be the next large step in reducing recoil of 'Mech-mounted weapons. Using a special hydraulic fluid containing a mix of high-volume, low-density nano-particles of various advanced polymer materials, the damper is able to reduce the recoil of even the heaviest of ballistic weapons, but at the risk of exploding on damage. The risk of exploding together with its prohibitively high construction cost, means it is still some way away from being adapted for general use.",
