Apollo is an unofficial nickname for the system. Functioning much like a Targeting Computer, the fire control system makes it more likely that the launcher will achieve a missile lock, though the dumb-fire MRMs are still more prone to miss the target than other missiles.<b><color=#F79232>Cannot be used with other Missile TTS and enables using Apollo MRM Ammo.</color></b>",
