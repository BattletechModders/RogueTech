The way Land Air Mechs carry and use Bombs has changed.
Previously the bombs were in ammo boxes tha used Carry Weight instead of Tonnage, and dropped from a weapon that occupied a Specialist Slot.
VTOL had their own system of bombs based on tabletop rules that was unique to them.

All previous weapons unique to either LAMs or VTOL have been replaced with new versions that can be used by either one. 
Various munition types that were previously only available for one are now available for both.
Players can salvage bombs, missile pods from a downed VTOL and put them on their LAMs etc.

Key Point: There are two main categories of Aircraft Weapons: WingMount and Bay

Wing Mounted: Each weapon is self contained, like a RL, bolt-on, or Handheld. 
They use up the mech's Carry Weight but do not require Tonnage.
They use special torso hardpoints, designated with a clawed wing icon, that only LAM have.  
Externally mounted weapons cause aerodynamic drag based on their weight which slows the LAM, 
greatly limits it's Jump and slightly increases it's sensor profile.
The weapon MUST be ejected to remove this penalty. (Even if the weapon is empty.)

Bomb Bay: LAM have two hardpoints for Bays. Bays weigh 0 tons but require slots. 
The full capability bay takes 2 slots, variant bays trade capability for smaller size.
Like conventional weapons Bays Ammunition boxes, generally 1-2 shots per ton. which isn't much, but again the weapon weighs zero.
Because everything is internal, Bomb Bays and their munitions cause no drag or increased sensor signature.

You can use both on the same unit. Wing Mounted gear is the easier option to augment a traditional mech build. Internal bays offer higher alpha strikes with bombs, and greater maximum capacities for dedicated bombers.

LAM lost 360 firing arc while flying like other fliers before them. This has a specific additional reason:
Bomb Tossing: Bombs now have max range influenced by Evasivepipsmod.

Cockatrice is immune to bomb drag, marked by unique flight system. Mechanically works by it NOT having "apply_bomb_drag_tag" in the mechdef

New Weapons:
Internal Weapons Bay - LAM Weapon suite for dropping bombs and missiles from the bay.
Missile Bay - LAM Weapon for dropping missiles from the bay.
Bomb Bay - LAM Weapon for dropping bombs from the bay.
WingMount Vulcan Gunpod - LAM weapon Replaces vulcan ammo type from old LAM system
WingMount MedPulse Laser - LAM weapon A pulse weapon with accuracy bonuses similar to the Vulcan.
WingMount Med Chem Laser - LAM weapon
WingMount Large Chem Laser  - LAM weapon

AA iATM Rack: +1 Evasion ignored.
Guided Bomb AOE dmg 25 to 15. AOE 50 to 60
MOAB AOE dmg 500 to 400 relative matching nerf to daisy cutter from a while ago
Light AA gained significant range.
Cluster Bomb gains +1 accuracy and bonus dmg vs squads

AGM (LAM item) and ATGM (VTOL item) from different authors merged. Now only half a ton each, parity with Light AA Missile.

Bomb Rack sizes are expanded from generally 1, 2, sometimes 4, to 1-5 for all 1-ton bombs except FAE.
Bomb Racks can now all only drop 1 bomb per attack.

LAM Phoenix missiles: No longer Streak, lower damage, longer range. More shots per ton/rack than specialized AGM or AA missiles.

Note "Rocket" types did not get internal [Bay] ammo. They have to be guided. So they can drop free, ignite and track.

Ideas:

No probably bad idea after thought ---- LAM shouldn't use normal Bolt-ons? They have this whole category of bolt-on-like weapons special to them with some overlap. But some bolt-on are utility they should have like Flare AMS. hmm

If possible we should ask for a way to block/disable Bombs in ground mode.

LAM Turbines could increase Carry Weight (deprecate LAM_WeaponsBay item). It's literally more thrust.

Goood idea done with changes --- Bomb Chute item, Antipersonnel or Missile hardpoint, internal bomb ammo type, one shot. Much more limited, or additional drops of basic bombs.

No. ----- Wing Hardpoint Item: Increases ShotsWhenFired for WingMounted Bombs by 1.
