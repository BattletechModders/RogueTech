    "Details": "The pilot of each ProtoMech sits in a high-tech cacoon of composite armor and neural link equipment. If breached by enemy fire it could become their coffin. Mech pilots talk about the mech becoming an extension of one's body. But for a protomech warrior their suit becomes their body. It's senses are fed directly into theirs. The impulses from their motor cortex are translated into its motions. Any violence done to, or by, the protomech is experienced as if the suit was their real body. Protomech pilots have a reputation for being crazy, but they don't all start that way; If the degenerative effects of Enhanced Imaging implants don't get you, the PTSD will.",
