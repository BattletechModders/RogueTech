    "Details": "The pilot of each ProtoMech sits in a high tech cacoon of composite armor and neural link equipment. If breached by enemy fire it could become their coffin. Mech pilots talk about the mech becoming an extension of one's body. But for a protomech warrior their suit becomes their body. It's senses are fed directly into theirs. The impulses from their motor cortex are translated into its motions. Any violence done to or by the protomech is experienced as if the suit was their real body. If you aren't crazy before getting into a protomech, you will be after a few years. If the degenerative effects of Enhanced Imaging doesn't get you, the PTSD will.",
