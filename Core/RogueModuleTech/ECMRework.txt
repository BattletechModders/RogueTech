Stealth rework concept

Combined ECM/ECCM

ECM can toggle strong Active/Passive
-Provides jamming
-Strong Shield when passive

EWS Cannot toggle, Shield

Some ECM Permanent (carapace, lootable CLPS)

C3 Combined
-Provide Improved Vision/Signature on enemys
-Buff Ally Sensors

	ECM/C3 Rework
	
	-ECM and EWS changed primary effects
	-ECM Affects Jamming, reducing detection capacity
	-EWS provides ECM Shield, protecting against enemy detection
	
	-Jam/Shield reduce an attackers accuracy by 0.5 per point now, to a maximum of -7 No sensors
	
	-ECM/ECCM effects combined into a Single Aura
	
	-Stealth has been delinked from ECM mode. Still requires a ECM to exist.
	
	-C3 Systems have received a combined Aura
	-Debuffing Enemies to be easier seen
	-Ally Buff for improved Sensors
