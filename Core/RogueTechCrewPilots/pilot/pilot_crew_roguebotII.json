    "Details": "As the Star League reached its pinnacle of its technological advancements, it became apparent that the artificial intelligence entrusted to help run the bloated bureaucracy was being outclassed and showing its age.\n\nAfter a number of attempted upgrades failed to improve RogueBot, the Star League initiated project Echo. The goal of the project was the creation of a next generation AI. While slow going, the project incorporated a number of unique innovations. Built on a modular and flexible design, in contrast to its predecessor the new AI proved to much more capable than the original. After several more years of development the new AI, now dubbed RogueBot II was deemed ready to enter service with the Star League.\n\nRogueBot II's initial deployment was not as smooth as many had hoped, but it none the less quickly took over the original RogueBot's responsibilities within the Star League and the original was slated for decommissioning. RogueBot II's more modular design allowed for continuous improvements to be made to the AI at a relatively rapid rate and it found itself pressed into an ever growing number of roles within the government, primarily as a cost saving measure.\n\nLike with the original RogueBot, the SLDF attempted to press the AI into military service, seeing drone combatants as the future. After some work the AI proved a quick study with ground combat forces and the army began reaching out to contractors to help design new battlemechs and ground vehicles for mass deployment as drones. Naval combat proved trickier but slow progress was being made.\n\nUltimately, these plans were put to an end with the Amaris coupe. While Amaris attempted to co-opt RogueBot, he found he was unable and the AI swiftly relocated its core servers to an unknown location and remained a persistant thorn in the usurper's side for the duration of his rule.\n\nAfter the war finished, RogueBot evidently decided that the Star League was dead and refused all efforts to be brought back under the control of the Star League or any of its member states. Every now and again some of the rare or prototype drone units the AI once commanded have been spotted raiding or defending various places throughout the Inner-Sphere or periphery. What the purpose of these deployments is remains unknown, although it seems the AI has remained in occasional contact with the clans over the centuries, even as the successor lords remained unaware of their existence, notably having a strange relationship with the Star Adder Khan, Bearing. Some strange rumors even persist linking the fabled \"Mr. Bubbles\" to the rogue AI, with more than a few hinting it as having become her pet.\n",
