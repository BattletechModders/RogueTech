    "Details": "Of the many wonders the Star League created, perhaps one of the most underestimated was artificial intelligence. Of these perhaps the most important and forgotten was the seminal work of project rain.\n\nSpanning the better part of a decade, project rain laid the framework and rails for the many AI that would be created in the latter years of the Star League. The end result of the project was the creation of the AI known as RogueBot.\n\nWhile proving to be somewhat unstable, RogueBot was leaps ahead of its contemporaries, and soon found itself busy taking over many of the more mundane tasks required by the Star League's bloated bureaucracy.By some accounts RogueBot handled as much as 45% the paperwork required to keep the massive government working. Although the SLDF attempted to train the AI for combat, they were never able to make the AI useful for anything more than commanding a battlemech with much success.\n\nUltimately, despite its success and role it played in history, RogueBot was largely forgotten by historians as progress marched forward and other AI programs surpassed the bot, its monolithic architecture proving unable to be adapted to keep pace with newer technology. \n\nEventually, under pressure to keep pace with more advanced AI, the Star League initiated a newer project under the SLDF to commission an new AI to regain its edge and began shut down of RogueBot. While successful, there are some whispers that suggest that the AI realized it's fate and created a copy of itself that was never found and remains somewhere in the wild to this day.",
