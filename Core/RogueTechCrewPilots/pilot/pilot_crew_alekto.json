    "Details": "Of the many Word of Blake operatives, few are as feared as Alicia \"Lady Alekto\" Sebrle. Born on the world of Sarna, the brash and outspoken Alicia often found herself at odds with Capellan authorities, while at the same time carefully watched as a having all the potential to make an excellent Maskirovka agent.\n\nThis was all put to an end with the 4th Succession War. When Davion invaded her homeworld, the 23 year old Alicia found herself pushed into the frontline as a member of a resistance cell defying the Federated Suns occupation of the world. Here Alicia found herself rising though the ranks until she was the leader of the most active cell on the world. While estimates vary, most historians place her activities as claiming 1500 - 2900 lives of Davion occupation forces.\n\nAfter a particular gruesome attack on a Davion regional headquarters, FedSuns troops had had enough and began retaliatory strikes against the population. Fearing for the lives of her loved ones, Alicia used her contacts in the Maskirovka to arrange them to be smuggled off world so that she could continue her campaign against the FedSuns occupiers. Unfortunately for Alicia, one of the citizens killed by the Davion retaliation was a distant relative of the Chancellor himself. As such the Maskirovka decided to avenge the Chancellor and to deal with a citizen they viewed as becoming too popular and so they betrayed Alicia, shooting down the dropship carrying everyone Alicia had ever truly cared for and selling out the location of her cell's headquarters to a local Davion commander.\n\nDavion jumped at the chance to deal with this thorn in their side once and for all and mercilessly bombed the entire village that housed her headquarters. Badly wounded, Alicia somehow survived the attack, dragging her ruined body several miles before collapsing near a remote and secret Comstar listening post. Found by a patrol, Alicia was smuggled off world, with the local Comstar Demi-Precentor seeing her potential as an operative for them. Despite the scars now covering her body, Alicia would fully recover thanks to cybernetic implants that were surgically embedded in her.\n\nFilled with hatred for all the successor lords, it was of little surprise that Alicia, now going by the code name \"Lady Alekto\", sided with the Word of Blake when the schism within Comstar occured. When the Jihad broke out, Alekto soon made a terrifying name for herself. Unafraid to order even the largest scale war-crimes imaginable, Alekto brilliantly masterminded numerous devastating strikes against the successor lords over the years of the brutal war. In addition it was found that she had a knack for designing battlemech loadouts, that while appearing odd, turned out to be highly effective and virtual nightmares to face. Her personal 'Firebird' was so completely devestating it was said to be able to ignite entire forests and overheat lances in a single pass.\n\nAlekto's fate remains unknown as she vanished in the chaos that was the aftermath of the Jihad. While some claim she is dead, she remains on virtually every Inner-Sphere state's most wanted lists and some captured Blakists have stated that Alekto would one day return to bathe the Sphere in cleansing fire one last time.",
