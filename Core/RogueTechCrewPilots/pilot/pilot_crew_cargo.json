    "Details": "Carl \"Cargo Vroom\" Vranich was born on Alpheratz in the Outworlds Alliance and is often regarded as one of the most prolific vehicle designers to have ever lived. \n\nGrowing up in a rather spartan household typical of the periphery, Cargo opted out of school from an early age with necessity forcing him to work as soon as he was able to help support his family. Initially Cargo learned the family trade as a run of the mill vehicle mechanic, however it became quickly that Cargo was meant for more as he showed a knack for not just fixing vehicles, but improving upon them.\n\nBy his 21st birthday, Cargo found himself drafted into the Alliance Borderers as a tank mechanic. Here Cargo quickly rose through the ranks of the unit's engineering corps, proving not only hard working but able to diagnose and and fix issues that even mechanics with 30 years more experience with those models could not. \n\nBy his 25th birthday, Cargo found himself the head mechanic on a detachment of the Borderers stationed on Cerberus when fate struck in the form of a deep raid by DCMS troops. As Kuritan forces struck the base Cargo was stationed at, they scattered the battalion defenders and began tearing through the hangers destroying vehicle after vehicle. Provoked into rage by watching days of his hard work going up into smoke, it is said Cargo grabbed the nearest few fellow mechanics by their shirts and shoved them in the closest tank to them. Taking the lead, Cargo then proceeded to lead the completely green crew in fierce defensive action. Cargo and his makeshift crew not only held out while crucial reinforcements arrived, but also succeeded in crippling 2 mechs and outright destroying one. For his quick thinking and heroic efforts, Cargo was awarded some of the nation's most prestigious military service awards. When offered monetary awards Cargo turned them down, instead requesting that he be allowed to bring his beloved pet ferret with him to work, a request a rather stunned high command accepted.\n\nFor the next decade Cargo served in the duel roles as both the head mechanic of the Borderers and as a tank commander in its command company before largely retiring from front-line service. This was at the behest of the Alliance high command, who had come to value his ever increasing skill at designing vehicle variants that were both cheap to produce and extremely cost effective.\n\nNow heading a design bureau, Cargo has become one of these most despised people alive to many mechwarriors. So terrifying are the designs he has produced that many a mechwarrior has called them \"bullshit\" or decried that mechs are supposed to be the kings of the battlefield, not tanks. Perhaps it is not surprising then that when Cargo makes trips to the field for studies, he does so primarily amongst other tank crews.\n",
