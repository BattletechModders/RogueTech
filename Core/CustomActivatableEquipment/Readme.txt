!WARNING! This version of CAE disabling vanilla aura COMPLETELY. I have to do it cause vanilla aura's code is very bad. 
Original code recalculating all auras for all combatant pairs every frame which is drop performance down especially if there many units on battle field.
My auras implementation written from scratch and using collides making Unity do all work for compare distances.
!NOTE! FrostRaptor's AurasHelper is assumed to be incompatible new auras code. But cause original auras disabled it assumed to be not needed.

  NOT NEEDED ANY MORE. KEEPED FOR HISTORICAL REASONS.
  "auraUpdateFix": "Position" - type of fixing updating aura while unit movement.
                                Some basics: vanilla's code updating auras while unit moving looks like sabotage. If someone under my command write something like this he/she will be fired immediately.
                                !EVERY! frame while unit moves method recalculating all auras invoked, and this method is very slow, 
                                worst of all it is called in frame draw thread which inflicts huge FPS drop if there is ECMs at battlefield.
                                I've throttle calling this method. I'm offering next throttling strategies:
                                "None" - vanilla behavior
                                "Never" - fastest method. Auras not updating while moving, only at end of move or jump. 
                                          Drawback of this - you will see stealth animations only at end of move. But cause it is turnbased game it will not alter gameplay at all.
                                "Position" - auras updating while moving, but frequency of updates controlled by moving distance eg every 20 meters for example. 
                                          Distance controlled by auraUpdateMinPosDelta.
                                "Time" -  - auras updating while moving, but frequency of updates controlled by moving time eg every 2 seconds. Time delta controlled by auraUpdateMinTimeDelta.
                                I'm suggesting Position strategy with update every 20 meters, cause, i think, this settings is compromise between performance and visual.  
                                Maybe later i will reimplemented update strategy to use unity's collides subsystem it will remove any visual drawbacks cause auras will be updated only when it is needed.

    if ComponentRefInjector is installed (ModTek 3.0+ Mods/ModTek/Injectors/ComponentRefInjector.dll)
	you can create weapon addon component. Weapon addon can have target component - weapon it is attached to. 
	inside MechDef in inventory list two optional fields was added. "LocalGUID" and "TargetComponentGUID"
	non empty "TargetComponentGUID" means this component have dedicated target inside this MechDef.
	Relevant UI in mech lab been added to give user ability to select addon target.

    to make UpgradeDef a weapon addon you need to make two things.
	1. Create WeaponAddonDef json file and add it to any mod manifest
	2. Add AddonReference to UpgradeDef custom section

	"Custom": {
		"AddonReference":{ 
			"installedLocationOnly":true,     - if true user can only select weapons from same location as target for this addon

			"notTargetable":false,  - if true instead of targeting addons will be added to all suitable weapons. 
			                          !NOTE! "notTargetable" component will not share crits with weapon it adds modes
									  cause they are not counted as attached. "Location":"{target}" is not resolved also

    if StatisticEffectDataInjector is installed (ModTek 3.0+ Mods/ModTek/Injectors/StatisticEffectDataInjector.dll)
	you can define Location field in statisticData
	if this field is set components from other locations can't be target for this statistic effect
	works for passive and activatable effects (not working for auras, abilities and weapon impact/on-fire effects)
	Location:"{current}" means location where component is installed
	Location:"{above}" means location where component is installed and only one nearest component placed in location 
	                   above current is affected. 
	Location:"{onlyone}" means location where component is installed and only one component placed in location current is affected.
	                     Affection is tracked by effect id. 
	Location:"{adjacent}" means ONE, just ONE location toward center from current (where component is installed).

	also Location is processed if target is not only component but unit. If unit is target for the effect, effect becomes location specific
	!NOTE! not all unit statistic effects can be specific for location. Even more you should count every effect to be not location specific unless 
	its locational nature mentioned explicitly. If you set non statistic value not processed by location - effect changes nothing.

    if StatisticEffectDataInjector is installed (ModTek 3.0+ Mods/ModTek/Injectors/StatisticEffectDataInjector.dll)

GLOBAL SETTINGS 
Idea that unit inflicts all enemy units protected by ECM just standing in ECM range is looks insane and illogical to me.
So original counter ECM behaviour is changed. All units have sensors aura not connected to component. This aura is used to counter ECMs.
All enemies in this aura receive penalty to stealth charges.
Sensors aura is defined at CAE settings.
It have same definitions as component aura described above

C3 implementation

if unit have at least one tag from C3NetworkEncounterTags in its encounter tags, its RANGE (and only RANGE) to-hit modifier will be calculated differently
Math:
code will iterate all allies of current unit and search for unit closest to target having at least one C3 encounter tag same as current unit.
example:
 C3NetworkEncounterTags: "C3_network_a", "C3_network_b"
 unit A: have "C3_network_a"
 unit B: have "C3_network_b"
 unit C: have "C3_network_a", "C3_network_b"
 unit D: have "C3_network_b"
while detecting RANGE modifier for unit A only unit C will be tested
while detecting RANGE modifier for unit B units C and D will be tested
while detecting RANGE modifier for unit C units A, B and D will be tested 
Eg. there are two types of C3 networks - "C3_network_a", "C3_network_b", network A units A and C, network B units B,C and D
When closest unit found its distance to target (C3-distance) is used to calculate RANGE instead of current unit distance(original distance).
Exceptions: 
1. C3-distance should be less than original distance, if not original distance will be used
2. C3-distance less than minimal weapon range, C3-distance is counted equal to weapon min range. Eg short range modifier will be used.

NOTE even if RANGE modifier is 0 it is still will be added to list of weapon modifiers in case C3-distance is used for calculation.

Encounter tags by statistic effect

you can add or remove unit encounter tag by applying statistic effect
Statistic name should be "ADD_ENCOUNTER_TAG_<encounter tag name>"
"ADD_ENCOUNTER_TAG_<encounter tag name>" is float, default 0
if value is greater than 0 tag will be added if less or equal removed.

!!!NOTE!!!
if you are using Abilifier to limit effects appliance by encounter tags you should note 
Abilifier does no handle encounter tags dynamic nature. 
Example you have component applying passive bonus A only if encounter tag B is set.
encounter tag B added by passive statistic effect by component C.
If component C is installed before A - most things is ok, component C will be processed before A 
and add encounter tag B before component A processing. Bonus will be applied. 
But if component C installed after component A, on processing component A, unit will not have encounter tag B, bonus will be skipped.
Even if bonus applied correctly on component C destruction tag B will be removed, but bonus will remain still cause does not handle encounter tag removal.
Same story if component C adds tag B as activatable. Bonus will not be applied cause activatables processed after passive components.

That is why only method correctly working in dynamic is - made "ADD_ENCOUNTER_TAG_<encounter tag name>" as activatable and tag bonus itself as
aura with proper "neededTags" setting. Aura effect will be applied or removed according encounter tags even if changed.
Also it is very bad idea to apply encounter tags needed for aura to be have an effect by another aura. 
Only safe place for it is activatable section. 

You can make aura lowering "ADD_ENCOUNTER_TAG_<tag from C3NetworkEncounterTags>" statistic to simulate counter C3 electronic
