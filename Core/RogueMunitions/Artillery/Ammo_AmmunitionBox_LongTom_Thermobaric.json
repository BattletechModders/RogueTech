    "Details": "A thermobaric or Fuel Air Explosion (FAE) explosion occurs when fuel is aerosolized with a scattering charge and then detonated. The resulting explosion is significantly more energetic than a conventional high explosive of the same mass. While the name suggests an incendiary effect the fuel is detonated not burnt. The heat is immense but of very short duration; however flammable materials are likely to be ignited. Primary damage is caused by the massive blast followed by a near vacuum in the area, which quickly collapses. The shockwaves are devastating to structures and armored units. Exposed personal who are unlucky enough not to be vaporized by the blast often die slowly, lungs and eardrums ruptured by the catastrophic pressure differentials. Ammo Bins contain the rounds needed for projectile-based weaponry, with at least one bin required per weapon type. Upon receiving a Critical Hit, any remaining ammunition stored inside an Ammo Bin will explode dealing damage to the install location. Risk can be mitigated with the use of C.A.S.E. ",
