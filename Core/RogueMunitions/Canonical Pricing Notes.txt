Canonical Pricing Notes

Deliberate changes:

Chem Lasers
Most AC2 price increased.
UAC2 - Doubled to match UAC generally being more expensive than standard AC
NARCs - just too many differences in implementation
Tandem and Precision AC ammo - Price cut
HVAC price cut
ATM/iATM - Prices cut
Caseless ammos priced to at least same cost per shell as standard, so the boxes are twice as expensive.

Questionable Canon Pricing

Arrow IV overpriced relative to other arty if not for a guided missile?

MRM ammo underpriced?
