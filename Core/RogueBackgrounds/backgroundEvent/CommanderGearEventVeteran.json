You thought that [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreDAMOCLES],DAMOCLES]] would've been enough excitement for a lifetime, and yet you find yourself once more itching to climb into the pilot seat. As you pace back and forth outside the 'Mech Bay, flanked by armored windows showcasing the inky black, Yang's voice catches your attention.\n\n\"Hey, Boss. She's out of [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreColdStorage],mothball]],\" he informs you, \"all ready to go.\"\n\nYour pacing abruptly stops and a small smile graces your face. Yang seems to have noticed, since he wears one of his own.\n\n\"Well?\" He asks, \"are you just gonna stand there grinnin' or are you gonna come check her out?\"",

She looks just as beautiful as the day you left her.\n\n\"I hope she didn't mind being kept in the broom closet all that time,\" you remark.\n\nYang shrugs. \"Eh. She had to come out eventually.\""
