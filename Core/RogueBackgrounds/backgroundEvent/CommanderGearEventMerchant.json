His jaw is set as he folds his arms and stares pointedly at you over the holographic display in the command center.\n\n\"Oh, c'mon!\" You protest. \"It's a <i>small</i> risk, sure, but the pay-off is absolutely worth it!\"\n\nYou and Darius have been arguing back and forth for the last fifteen minutes. You're convinced that you can flip this wayward shipment of <i>[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreHolovidMercenaries],MERCENARIES!]]</i> before anybody in the crew finds out about it. Darius, on the other hand, is not.\n\n\"Yang'll throw a fit if he hears about this. You know that,\" Darius reiterates. \"You're playing with fire here.\"\n\n\"And? Three <i>million</i>, Darius.\"\n\nEventually, he sighs and throws up his hands. \"Fine, go ahead, but don't whine to me if this comes back to bite us.\"",
