    "Details": "You approach the location of the dead drop with Yang and Sumire in tow. Both of them seem somewhat anxious, a stark comparison to your relative nonchalance.\n\n\"Dead drops like this always make me uncomfortable,\" Yang complains, his head on a swivel.\n\n\"You get used to them after a while,\" Sumire says, \"especially with the amount I get sent on.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not you, in case you hadn't noticed,\" comes Yang's reply.\n\n\"Can it, you two,\" you butt in.\n\nA small collection of crates sit neatly bundled at the precise location given, a locator beacon slowly blinking atop the pile.\n\nDespite being long removed from the jarhead life, your making friends with the quartermaster sure has paid off. This is the third package of goods that's been 'misplaced', and you're certainly not going to start complaining about them now.\n\nOnly one question remains - what goodies did you ask for this time?",
