You stand on the far side of the <i>Argo</i>'s 'Mech Bay, tapping entries into a datapad as all hands ferry weaponry, shells, and slabs of BattleMech armor off the carcasses of your rivals' 'Mechs.\n\n\"Hey, Boss,\" comes Yang's voice.\n\nYou look up from the pad and see him walking over, wiping greasy hands on a rag at his belt.\n\n\"One of these 'Mechs is in pretty good shape. We could get her runnin' again instead of needing to salvage her.\"",
