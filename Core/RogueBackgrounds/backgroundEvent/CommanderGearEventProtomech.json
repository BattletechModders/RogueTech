    "Details": "Ever since you'd been informed of the accident at the facility, you've been on edge. That place and the rigorous testing regimes have a special place in your nightmares. Staring out the window of the observation pod into the inky black, you start as you hear the bulkhead door open behind you.\n\n\"Oop, sorry, Boss,\" comes Yang's voice. The door quietly hisses shut behind him, leaving the two of you in almost complete silence. At least, until he speaks again. \"We just got back with the Leopard. It's exactly as the orbital scans said - the facility's toast.\"\n\nFor a brief moment, you don't know what to feel. What happened within those walls was a deeply formative experience for you.\n\n\"But,\" Yang continues, \"we did find something — a couple of those [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[ConceptProtoMech],ProtoMechs]] in complete shambles. I hope you don't mind, but we brought them back with us and I've had the boys take a look at fixing them up and seeing if we can get a full squad rolling.",

In a way, they were discarded just as much as you were. \"Let me know when they're ready.\"\n\nYang nods and turns to leave. He pauses to clap a hand on your shoulder. \"Will do, Boss,\" he answers, \"will do.\"",
