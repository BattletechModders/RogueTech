For most of the League's history, it has been ruled under martial law by a Captain-General, who by tradition is from [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreHouseMarik],House Marik]]. The cultural diversity and relative independence of its component regions are at once the greatest strength of the Free Worlds League, and its greatest weaknesses.",
