The Magistracy is a matriarchal society led by a Magestrix. This is an elected position open to any woman but largely controlled by [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreHouseCentrella],House Centrella]] due to the family's popularity. The Magistracy supports an open society that ensures the personal liberty of all citizens and their right to live their lives as they see fit.",
