    "Details": "This Word of Blake variant was first spotted in 3069, this Demon tank trades the turreted Gauss Rifle for a forward mounted Heavy Gauss Rifle with two tons of ammunition. The lasers are upgraded to Extended Range and the missile launcher is traded for a Streak version. The vehicle is also equipped with a Targeting Computer, C3i system, and fitted with an Extra-Light Fusion Engine to allow it to carry the HGR. The standard armor has also been replaced with Ferro-Fibrous Armor. The Demon was originally created by the SLDF as its standard fighting vehicle in 2716. A match for any light or medium BattleMech, the Demon had good maneuverability and was protected by ten tons of slab armor, most of it concentrated in its front. Due to the nature of its powerful main weapon the Demon was often used in ambush attacks and fought in pairs instead of the usual four-vehicle lance. The vehicle's main disadvantage was its lack of speed, which made it vulnerable to faster 'Mechs and other vehicles able to maneuver around and engage its weaker rear armor.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 4/6 Hex: 120/180 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Heavy Ferro\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       260     30\n<b>Left</b>         160     30\n<b>Right</b>       160     30\n<b>Rear</b>        120     30\n\n<b>Total</b>      700    120\n</color>",
