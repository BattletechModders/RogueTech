    "Details": "The J-37 Ordnance Transport is a support vehicle used for resupplying military units in the field. Based on the earlier J-27 Ordnance Transport, it has been produced in the Capellan Confederation by Ceres Metals since the twenty-eighth century, though production was halted by the Succession Wars. In response to the failings of the J-27, the J-37 is larger, with the ability to carry 17 tons of cargo, and better protected, replacing the vulnerable trailer with an enclosed hold. It also comes with a one-ton Infantry Transport Bay and carries 5.5 tons of combat-grade armor. The vehicle's high speed, powered by a Fusion Engine, allows it to quickly get to its destination and, if necessary, flee from the enemy.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Wheeled: Fast in open ground, slow in rough terrain.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 5/8 Hex: 150/240 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<b>Armor:</b> Ferro-Fibrous\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       155     25\n<b>Left</b>         130     25\n<b>Right</b>       130     25\n<b>Rear</b>         75     25\n<b>Turret</b>       95     25\n\n<b>Total</b>      585    125\n",
