Possessing less armour and weaponry than many comparable mechs, the 1AAX was designed as a highly mobile battlefield sniper; but struggled to survive once engaged by the enemy. A Partial Wing significantly boosted the designs mobility, whilst an Actuator Enhancement System bolstered the accuracy of the HPPC that constituted most of the designs fire power. The Small X-Pulse Laser and ER Medium Laser were insufficient fire power for anything other than anti infantry work, posing little threat to heavily armoured targets. The inclusion of Ferro Fibrous armour allowed the design team to somewhat improve protection, even if it still fell far behind that off other comparable mechs, whilst the Laser AMS provided a degree of protection against incoming missiles. Unsurprisingly the design suffered high losses in combat and many mech warriors refused their assignments; only accepting them once the alternatives were made clear.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Rugged</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.03</color></b>",
