## Features
- Over 2000 planets added.
- All the major factions added.
- Factions now lose proper standing when you fight against them.
- Removed Story.
- Starting with the argo on Galatea.
- Raised jumping distance to fit for the map.
- Raised Argo monthly costs for balancing reasons.
- Faction Screen now shows your 8 highest factions.
- Contracts on all planets can now go from 0,5 skulls to 5 skulls.
- There is no more local contracts and each planet generates 10 travel contracts.

## Tips
- Don't freak out if loading to the main menu takes abit longer, modtek does its while the skull is displayed.
- Since i am using the Tutorial skip you have to save and load once to use your commander in a mech.
- The starting planet only has one random contract(this is a known bug), all other planets will have 10 travel contracts.
- If you like local contracts back you have to edit mods\InnerSphereMap\StreamingAssets\data\simGameConstants\simGameConstants.json
