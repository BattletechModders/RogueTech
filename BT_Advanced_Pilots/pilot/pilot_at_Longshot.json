    "Details": "Born and raised on Larsha, one of the hubs of Periphery activity in the Confederation, Yue Doyle grew up a military girl. Her father served in the 5th Confederation Reserve Cavalry, piloting a Locust 1M. All through her youth, she listened to his stories about training and chasing off pirates.\r\n\r\nWhen she turned 18, she enrolled in the Duchy Regional Training Center on Zanzibar so she could fight beside her father in the 5th Reserve Cav. Just before she graduated, she heard news that he’d been killed during a raid by unmarked forces originating from Taurian space. That same week, she received an official dispatch assigning her to the 5th back on Larsha, placing her in her father’s old company. When she arrived, she was assigned to his Locust; a painful reminder of her recent loss. She proved to fill his boots more than adequately, and she turned down ever promotion to a heavier machine. Yue preferred her role as rapid response fire support, and she wasn't ready to give the chair over to someone who wouldn't appreciate the 'Mech's history. Eventually the brass informed her she had no choice when the next promotion offer came; upgrade or opt out. It's an easy guess what she chose, and it's just as easy to wager why she'd want to sign on with a Mercenary outfit with cause to venture out into the Rimward Periphery.",
