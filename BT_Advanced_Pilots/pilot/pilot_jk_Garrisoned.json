    "Details": "Garrison is a true son of Arcturus, the one time capital system of the Lyran Commonwealth and like any good citizen of the Commonwealth, he joined the military as soon as he was of age.  He tested well in the VR-pods and was promptly sent to Coventry Military Academy.  There he excelled in his tactics classes and was put on a fast track for being assigned to a line unit to replace the ever increasing losses during the 3rd Succession War.  Being given an early commission with the severely depleted Sixth Arcturian Guards, Garrison was sent to Starshine at the age of 21.\r\n\r\nOn Starshine he was assigned to be First Leutnant of a Support Lance where he was able to make excellent use of his academy training against pirate raiders and Free Worlds League units.  Where is Starshine you may ask?  Well, don't bother looking for it on star maps, its a dead world now.  What about the Sixth Arcturian Guards?  They no longer show on the rolls of active units for the Commonwealth - yet Garrison was there at the end of both.\r\n\r\nBarely a year into his new assignment, Garrison was thrust right into action.  During the Marik Civil War of 3014 (also known as Anton's Revolt), the Commonwealth decided to take advantage of the situation and sent the Sixth in to raid Griffith.  With the chaos of Anton's Revolt, the 1st Fusiliers of Oriente were slow to respond and the Sixth's raid was considered a rousing success.  During the fighting Garrison would bait the enemy into terrain of his choosing to allow his support lance to pepper the opposing force with indirect fire while performing slow withdrawals toward the other lances in his company.  The Hauptmann of the company took to saying the OpFor got 'Garrisoned' and it wasn't long before it stuck as his call sign.\r\n\r\nReturning to their post at Starshine, the Sixth was celebrating their victory in one of the larger domed habitats when the Fusiliers got their revenge.  Performing a Hover-Drop, a mobile force of Fusiliers attacked, catching the Sixth completely unaware.  Scrambling to get back to his 'Mech, Garrison found he was cut off by the Fusiliers' forces.  Over the next few days he bided his time until opportunity knocked in he form of a Fusiliers Hunchback 4P that was left in the old Sixth depot area for repairs.  Subduing the technicians, Garrison took control of the 'Mech and made to escape the depot.  There are many stories about what happened next, but the one thing every story has in common is that the depot was set off, causing a chain reaction that destroyed the Star League era air purifying system that kept the planetary domes habitable.  This ultimately led to the world being abandoned of the next few years, another casualty of the Succession Wars.\r\n\r\nWhile the 1st Fusiliers of Oriente made it off world mostly intact, the same could not be said for the Sixth, between their losses during the surprise assault, and the destruction of the depot - the Sixth ceased to be a solvent unit.  Garrsioned was one of the few to escape with his life and his new 'Mech.  But, even this bit of luck didn't last.  While in transit to the Jump Point, the Black Raiders pirates took advantage of the chaos and attempted to capture the DropShip ferrying Garrison and his 'Mech.  During a strafing run by a Black Raider AeroSpace Fighter, a freak accident occurred with the restraint system in the MechBay and the LRM pods in the Hunchback triggered, and it seemed that the techs had forgotten to remove the load during the frenzy to get off world.  The explosion caused a systematic failure resulting in the loading bay door opening, and all unsecured equipment was blown into space, including Garrison's HBK-4P.  While the DropShip was able to escape, Garrison was now without a unit, without a world and without a 'Mech.\r\n\r\nConsidering his past and knowing that both the world and unit he last served on have passed from existence, many believe Garrison to be jinxed, and considering how he wound up dispossessed and in the hiring halls, maybe there is something to it.  But Garrisoned is a skilled Tactician and he has a plan to get back in the game, even if he has had to take his lumps as a merc for nearly a decade.",
