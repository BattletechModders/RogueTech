        "Details": "Darius grew up on Nassau Heights, one of the hab stations orbiting the Aurigan Coalition world Artru. Thirty decks of economic stratification, with the corporate suits on the upper decks and everyone else crammed into the lower ones. His father was a deckhand and the whole family lived on Deck 28, two levels up from the bottom, with other station maintenance personnel. Twelve hours a day, six days a week, his father would load and unload cargo shuttles. Vacuum-sealed quillar and nutrient paste for common people, and luxury goods for the suits upstairs. According to Darius, he must've unloaded a thousand cases of Cassildan eel roe-plump, succulent eggs the size of melon balls. Never got to taste any, though. Any one of those tins would've cost him a half a year's wages. Suffice it to say that Darius got an eyeful of what he did not want to be on Nassau Heights, and did what he had to do to change his circumstances. By the age of sixteen, he struck out on his own, leaving with a handful of skills, an enormous web of contacts, and a rucksack full of that expensive caviar. And once he made it off of Nassau Heights, he never, ever looked back. He took up a career as a MechWarrior and eventually made it to the position of Executive Officer of Markham's Marauders, where his fortunes would be made for life. And now, he's decided it is time to get back into the cockpit for a little action.",
