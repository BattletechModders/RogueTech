    "Details": "John was on a fast track to command straight out of Albion Military Academy. Attached to the Ceti Hassars John would be captured by a Cappellan patrol after an intel snafu failed to warn them of recent movements in the area. Beagle was held prisoner for 4 years and was subject to intense interrogation techniques in the early years of his captivity.  On the fourth year Beagle would be sprung from prison by his old unit, now operating as a Mercenary band, and would assist in combat and command of what would later be known as Operation Gatecrasher. John has been running his own Mercenary unit on and off since his new found freedom but has been more recently looking for a company where he can find good return for his skills and experience.",
