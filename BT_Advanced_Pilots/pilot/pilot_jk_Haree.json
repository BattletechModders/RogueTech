    "Details": "Originally a ground-pounder NCO for a support unit in the 2nd Robinson Rangers, Paul was stationed on Breed for garrison duty, along with an up-and-coming mercenary unit called the Steel Jaguars.  Part of what made the Jaguars stand out was their rigorous training regimen which involved a lot of wargames.  During the time stationed on Breed, the Rangers and Jaguars participate in multiple exercises, at first pitting each unit against each other and later performing mixed unit operations.  It was during one of these exercises that Paul's life would take an unexpected turn.\r\n\r\nDuring an exercise, Paul's Company lost their Command Squad, but he was unwilling to concede defeat and Paul organized a trap to even the score.  Luring the Jaguar scout lance into a geothermal valley, Paul's squad signaled the mock trigger for his unit's SRM Inferno rounds, which had been placed along the most likely trail the OpFor lance would take - the combination heat overload of the geysers and Infernos shut down 3 of the 4 'Mechs, with the final 'Mech being dispatched with overlapping fire from Paul's 2 remaining squads.  The mercenary Command staff were so impressed with Paul that their CO, Doyle, offered him a billet in the Steel Jaguars when his tour with the Rangers was complete.  It was at this point that he took on the nickname Haree, some say it is because no mater how hairy the situation gets, he can turn it around and make it hairier for the enemy.\r\n\r\nDespite having very little BattleMech experience, Haree joined up with the Jaguars a year later and quickly adapted to the life of a MechWarrior.  His natural combat and leadership abilities helping to propel him through the ranks and it seemed like Haree had barely moved into his locker before he was granted command of a scout lance and then the company, which was expedited somewhat by his predecessor taking an AC/10 round through the cockpit.\r\n\r\nUnder Haree's guidance, he helped the Steel Jaguar Battalion become one of the premiere units to hire if you absolutely had to get the job done.  During his tenure as Captain his company had failed a contract only once, just prior to Haree retiring his mantle.  Despite appearances to the contrary, it wasn't this failure that made him stand down though.  Rather, it was the draw of his life long dream to take the money he had earned and settle down on his home world of Robinson.  Haree yearned to feel the grass between his toes instead of the burn of melting BattleMech armor in his nostrils.\r\n\r\nRecently Haree has seen his savings become just another casualty of the Succession Wars and has been drawn into trying to find an employer, with one eye on the dream he still holds on to.",
