    "Details": "Jackson Harker always wanted to fly. And he’d been born in the right place for it; the Outworld Alliance. Famous for their aerospace forces, which rivaled those of the Successor States themselves, the OA was the fork to Harker’s spoon; the butter on his toast. He joined up as soon as he could, and excelled in his preliminary testing. Like many aero recruits, he passed out during high-g training. Again, and again. But he never stopped passing out, which means he inevitably washed out. His recruiting officer suggested he try for Battlemech training; after all, jump jets might be a poor substitute for actual thrusters, but who knows? He might luck out and fall into assignment with one of the few remaining LAMs still in service. And with that, Harker put his nose to the grindstone, and graduated.\r\n\r\nHe lived on the high ground in training, and in service, and he patently refused any assignment to a machine that didn’t have jump jets. But that golden ticket never came, and after his assignment was over, he packed up and headed rimward, through the Taurian Concordat, looking for an outfit still sporting one of those rare gems: the Land-Air Mech. They might not be masters of the skies, but they came about as goddamn close as any machine with two legs aught to. One still needs to pay the bills, however, and so Ridgeline gladly takes any duty with Mercenaries having the same sort of free spirit and thirst for adventure he enjoys. And being huge fans of, or owning, a LAM certainly helps those prospects.",
