    "Details": "Kalida Hossein grew up on the water world of Athenry, amidst the salt spray of the sulfurous oceans and the jagged cliffs of the scant landmasses that dotted the planet. During her childhood, the planet was brought low by a mercenary group known as the Blue Star Irregulars, under contract with House Steiner. The invaders ingratiated themselves to the populous, becoming local celebrities before the Draconis Combine chased them off-world a year later. Their tenure there left a lasting impresson on many of the Athenry youth, and so when she came of age, Kalida joined the PDF hoping for a chance to sign up with an outfit like the BSI.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, living on an ocean-bound planet means unless a Great House decides to use you as a staging ground for further conquest, you aren’t likely to experience much in the way of excitement. Locally produced algae proteins and toxic seawater aren't particularly appealing to pirates, so Kalida found herself very bored most of the time. She also had another issue: tours on surface patrol craft revealed she was direly prone to seasickness. A transfer to underwater welding detail curtailed her seasickness issues a little, and gave her time at the controls of IndustrialMech, which she hoped would translate to a career with a mercenary company at some point.\r\n\r\nAfter her tenure in the PDF was up, she had enough money saved to transfer off-world, wanting nothing more than to get away from all that water. Unfortunately, Battlemech neurohelmets trigger her seasickness, which she discovered during her first contract, so any outfit that employs her on better keep extra dimenhydrinate on hand just in case.",
