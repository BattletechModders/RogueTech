    "Details": "Originally from the Duchy of Andurien in the Free Worlds League, James Pato grew up tinkering with anything he could get his hands on.  He was drawn to an apprenticeship as a MechTech, first for AgroMechs in his local community.  Then later to BattleMechs, after being called upon to help the local garrison with a broken 'Mech passing over his family's property.\r\n\r\nWorking for the militia, he quickly rose through the ranks and became the local subject matter expert on the coding for 'Mech's Targeting and Tracking Systems (TTS) and internal diagnostic computers.  More than once his custom adjustments had led to MechWarriors in his unit nearly dying in the field, which almost cost him his position.  He found himself putting in countless hours behind the command couch of BattleMechs in order to understand what his pilots experience, eventually earning his own title as MechWarrior.\r\n\r\nHis ability to find work as either MechTech or MechWarrior has granted him freedom to travel around the Rimward Periphery, searching for LosTech - with an eye out for Star League era TTS.  He's heard rumors there was once a totally autonomous BattleMech drone project run in secret but has yet to find any real evidence.  If he were to find such a LosTech cache, it would allow him to establish his own brand of TTS that would rival the best the Inner Sphere has to offer.",
