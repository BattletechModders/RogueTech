        "Details": "Born on Coromodir to a pair of high-ranking military officers, Blue had little choice in her upbringing or career path - joining the Aurigan Coalition's military was her destiny from the moment she was born, and though she did as her parents bid, it was with smouldering resentment rather than enthusiasm. This won her few favors with her fellow officers in training, and after an incident in 'anger management' that left another trainee in the hospital, she was quietly shuffled off to join with the rowdier - and rather less sheltered - crowd of young MechWarriors.\r\n\n\nWith her parents patronage, she was given into Raju Montgomery's care. Here, for the first time, she found something she was both good at and enjoyed. She quickly acquired the callsign Aether, through her ability to remain untouched, seemingly intangible and ephemeral, through a hail of incoming fire. Though not important enough socially to rub shoulders with the heir to the Coalition, sharing a common teacher often led to Blue sharing training with Kamea Arano. When it became clear that Blue was becoming rather inappropriately enamoured with the royal lady, she was again - quietly - transferred to the furthest reaches of the Reach. There was only so far her parents' reputation could go.\r\n\n\nTragedy struck, as both of her loyalist parents were killed in the opening moments of Espinoza's coup. With Kamea and Raju reported dead, her parents gone, and the Directorate heading in a direction she was unwilling to support, Aether took advantage of the chaos to simply disappear. She's back now though, and ready to seek revenge upon those who destroyed her life - and who threatened, exiled, and hunted her liege.",
