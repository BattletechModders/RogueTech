    "Details": "Pistol doesn't like to talk about her childhood. Her story starts with the first time she went to prison, which she proudly hails as 'growing up'. After that, her life was a blur of petty crime, thuggery, and gang time. Unlike a lot of the roughs she ran with, Pistol used her head. She was smart, and ruthless, and someone with her capabilities wasn't long for petty crime. Pirates eventually swept her away to a life of cargo theft, raiding stockpiles, and fleeing the authorities in multiple systems. The pirates were more wily than the low-rent crooks she'd been with, but her savvy kept her fingerprints off most of their heists.\r\n\r\nAfter a duel with a member of a rival pirate crew got blood on her hands for the first time, Pistol started getting a tattoo for each mark she knocked off; often times double-tapping by collecting bounties on the riff-raff as a side gig. That sort of work suited her tastes, and the criminal aspects of things started to fall to the wayside. The other pirates noticed, and not wanting to lose their share of her bounty takes, they offered her a spot among the few 'Mech jocks they had. She was put at the controls of a primitive, derelict Shadow Hawk, and her eye for killing only grew sharper. She found that she equally enjoyed hunting targets with her autocannon or her sidearm, and unfortunately for the rest of the rabble, her resolve to leave the pirate life only got stronger.\r\n\r\nPistol snuck away one evening when the rest of the pirates were in a drunken stupor, leaving word of their whereabouts in the ear of the authorities and collecting the bounty. She used the cash to get off-world, and register with the MRB as a pilot-fore-hire, hoping to shack up with a more reputable lot who favored bounty hunting as much as she did. Amusingly, having to register with the MRB forced her to use her real name (which she hates), so any potential commanders might take care not to use it in casual conversation.",
