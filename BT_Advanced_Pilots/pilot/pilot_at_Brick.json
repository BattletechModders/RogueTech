    "Details": "Grigori Izzo wasn’t born, he was built. At least, that what it father told him. “No kid as big as you came from anything but a box!” he’d exclaim, and Grigori would giggle. And he was a big kid. Not too quick on the uptake though. He spent a long time getting bullied before he realized what his size meant, but once he did, he used it to full advantage. And the same thing applied to his schooling. Once he got his teeth into a subject, he absorbed it like a sponge. So when it came time to do something with himself after school, he wanted to go big. And nothing was big like a Battlemech. He wanted to make the Inner Sphere his playground, and so he enrolled in the Hero Training Institute; racking up significant debt, but determined to be a Mechwarrior.\r\n\r\nTraining at HTI was spotty to put it politely, but after nearly being thrown out for getting into a fistfight with his Tactics and Strategy 112 “professor”, he graduated along with a class of fourteen other Mechwarriors, and promptly fell into the ranks of the Dispossessed. There were more men than machines, and even though Izzo had a talent for using every ounce of armor on his ‘Mech weathering enemy fire, and a fair grasp of shooting straight, he was stuck waiting with so many others, hoping for his big break with a Merc outfit in the Rimward Periphery.",
