    "Details": "Once House Arano regained their throne, and Lady Kamea Arano reclaimed her crown, the Restoration efford ended, and so did the flow of money from the Centrellas. The fate of those displaced by the end of a war rarely gets shared in any history book, this war included, and many loyal Mechwarriors and vehicle crewfolk were left without prospects. The Magistracy has new politics to attend to now, and former Aurigan soldiers like Clinton have to do what they can.\r\n\r\nDubbed 'Plato' by his lancemates due to a penchant for debate over off-hours drinks, Mechwarrior Knox is otherwise a fairly unremarkable soldier, aside from the bittersweet loyalty he has towards his old outfit and nation. He feels betrayed, but at the same time proud of his role in re-securing the Arano heritage, wearing that weight like a veteran would. He gets on well with most crews, and has little or naught to say about much, unless there's an open beer and a friendly conversation at hand. He seems content to follow orders and serve his contract; quietly continuing to be a good soldier for whoever cuts his checks.",
