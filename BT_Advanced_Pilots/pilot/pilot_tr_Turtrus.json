		"Details": "\"To achieve victory we must make the enemy blind and deaf by sealing his eyes and ears.\"\r\n\r\nRaised on the Periphery world of Fronc, Sam spent many years serving as infantry in the Colonial Marshals defending colonists from pirates. When his promotion finally went through he was shipped off to the Institute of War in Canopus for Mechwarrior training where he specialized in signals warfare and developed a fascination with cat ears.\r\n\r\nSam's time in the Institute was cut short however, when the news reported that back home a group of Colonial Marshals had taken hostages and demanded independence for the colonies. Rather than wait to see if he'd be declared guilty by association, Sam took the first jump ship out of system and struck out on his own, offering his skills to mercenary outfits throughout the Periphery.",
