    "Details": "People like to talk about the pirate life as though it were some romantic, free-wheeling vacation where you stick it to the Man (the Inner Sphere, in this case), and live the high life, complete with blackjack and hookers. At least, that’s what people who’ve never suffered from a pirate attack like to dream, or those who’ve never tried living as one. The reality is piracy is dirty, cruel, dangerous, and takes the right type of merciless cunning to make sure the only dagger is the one in your hand, not in your back. And Yessica Durant fits that bill.\r\n\r\nThe safest way to live in the Tortuga Dominions is not to spend too much time in the Tortuga Dominions, and Yessica knew the hallways and hidey-holes of most of the Jumpships in the Tortugan fleets better than she knew the way around the apartment she crashed in when she was forced planetside during down time. And she knew where all the best gambling was to be found. Which, naturally, is probably the reason she’s now in the Rimward Periphery, looking for more “reputable” work. And if it is, she ain’t saying. She knows her way around a ‘Mech though, and as far as she tells it, that’s all any potential employers need to know about her. That, and to just leave her alone, lest she bite the hand that feeds.",
