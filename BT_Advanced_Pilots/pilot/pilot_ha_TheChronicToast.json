    "Details": "Nathaniel Stoyanov, known by his callsign TheChronicToast (or Toast for short), is a character with a mysterious past and an unequalled love of toaster pastries. Many pin him as affiliated with the former periphery mercenary company \"Absolution's Gap\" which gained notoriety by assisting Kamea Arano's coalition forces in the Aurigan Reach; though whether this is true isn't something he's likely to comment on.\nHis upbringing is a familiar one for a MechWarrior in the rimward periphery. Born to an immigrant family that had positioned itself powerfully as agricultural barons on Heliat, his family were betrayed by those that deemed them outsiders to the local insular culture. Evading his captors, his family missing and their holdings destroyed, he fled off world. Hiring on as a novice pilot he continued life as a merchant guard; providing himself a taste of dealing with tactical situations in underpowered and poorly maintained 'Mechs.\nIt was in these formative years he realized that with unexpected but surprisingly reckless tactics an underdog could get an edge on a superior foe; even more so if one was willing to risk everything to accomplish the mission at hand. With this knowledge firmly grasped his piloting skill and deployment count grew, eventually winning seats in various mercenary outfits. He earned his keep but never stayed in one place for long as he always gained a reputation for burning through his 'Mechs if it meant a mission success; company finances be darned.\nEventually he got pulled into the historic events surrounding Kamea Arano and the civil war with the Directorate, but that is a story for another day if you can get him to tell it. As it stands, he's a solid pilot with a few tales to share.\n\"Every action has a cost on the battlefield. Make the sacrifices needed for victory a personal endeavor and your lance mates will thank you when its over.\"",
