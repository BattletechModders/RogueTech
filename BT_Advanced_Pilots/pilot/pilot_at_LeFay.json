    "Details": "Most folk from the Outworlds Alliance favor peace above war, and isolationism over opening themselves up to the outside world. After the Reunification War, people in the Periphery largely just wanted to be left alone, and the OA was no exception. Droves of people who hadn't fit in within the confines of the Great Houses had fled or migrated there to live simply, with several small groups of Luddites and other fringe thinkers making their homes among the like-minded, or at least the like-willed. This is the part of the story where you'd expect to be told about the 'wolf among sheep' or the 'problem child' who stood out through her addiction to thrills and violence. LeFay's story is no such tale. Anha's simply a Mechwarrior that sought to keep the peace, and so trained for war in the hopes to never really have to fight. Her main talent lies in coaxing her sensors to perform better than most, making her very adept at calling down fire from friendly Aero assets onto the heads of the pirates that tended to beleaguer the Alliance. She got her callsign because of her 'wizardry' with sensors, and the fact that her assigned ride was a Merlin, both in training and in combat, so her lance mates found it funny. Her own personal style doesn't help though; with her heavily shadowed eyes and dark hair she looks every part the witch, and to some unlucky pirates, maybe she was.\r\n\r\nShe came to be among the many Mercenary pilots for hire because her ride was shot out from under her in a raid, and her command simply couldn't afford another one, so she left. All she really knew was piloting 'Mechs, and farm work didn't sound like much of a life after that. So, she threw her name in the proverbial hat, and waited patiently for a Merc command to give her a shot.",
