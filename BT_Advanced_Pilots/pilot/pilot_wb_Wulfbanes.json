        "Details": "Wulf Hardy is Draconis affiliated, sporting a rough past from the Kesai liberation. While sporting a weak constitution and bad allergies, he is dependable and overall uplifting to be around.  The accent of his homeworld leads him to insist it should be spelled Wulf or not at all.  He's picked a moniker coring WFH and WVR infidels of all makes.\r\n\r\nWulfbanes adopts cats when planetbound.  There may have been an incident with SRMs when there was a chase in the cockpit.  He likes naps, going fast, and hearing the cacophony after missiles take flight.  He doesn't like plant life, getting hit, or anything that messes with the gyro.  Nobody wants to disturb a lounging cat, and nobody wants a repeat misfire.",
