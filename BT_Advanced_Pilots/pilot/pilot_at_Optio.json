    "Details": "When asked, Dermot Laughlin is content to simply tell people he is from the far side of the Magistracy of Canopus, and leave it at that. That he served in a milita, piloting a Wasp that had a couple of Flamers installed in the leg in place of the missile rack, and that he didn’t do much beyond some minor scrumming with pirates and some civil engineering using his ‘Mech as a substitute crane.\r\n\r\nBut the manner in which he carries himself, and especially the way he talks, tell a different story, and it’s one that doesn’t come anywhere near matching the words that come out of his mouth when you can get him to talk about himself. And one look at the bookshelf in his quarters confirms he has some pretty serious investment in the workings and histories of ancient empires, specifically the Romans. And this seeming obsession reflects in his demeanor on the battlefield; he will bark orders and make calls if his commanding officer is too slow to respond to changing battlefield conditions, and brush off any remand after the fact. But when paired with a mind like his, he is efficient, and supportive, and he will echo commands to the rest of his compatriots, helping keep operations orderly and regimented.",
