    "Faction": "MagistracyOfCanopus",
    "Age": "32",
    "Details": "The Magistracy of Canopus may be blessed with its first proper martial academy in several centuries, thanks to the Trinity Alliance and its partners the Capellan Confederation and the Taurian Concordat, but not every Mechwarrior is given the chance to attend. And some who qualify choose not to, thinking the new alliance to be a farce. Sharon is one of those latter folks. She graduated from a provinical academy, and recieved the very best, roughest, most experience-driven training the undefunded MAF could muster with scant subsidy. Her assignment had been to a Spider 5D, and she loved every moment of it. The speed was what appealed to her most, and it always will. She believes that not only is speed armor, it is also life.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for her, she talks as fast as she likes her 'Mechs to run, and her scathing opinions regarding the Capellan Confederation attracted the wrong sort of attention. She was discharged without pension (thought not dishonorably) to avoid any undue friction between the MAF and their new advisiors, and so struck out on her own, looking for like-minded soldiers to sign on with; preferably those who dislike the Confederation.",
