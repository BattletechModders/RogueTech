    "Details": "Johannes Seville hates being the center of attention. He'd grown up a good-looking kid, always the target of the flirtations of the girls at school, and by the end of his education he'd had more than a few beaus. At the time he loved it; the adulation, the ease with which he could manpulate teachers with a smile, or get favors from classmates. Everyone liked him.\r\n\r\nHis sharp appearance turned out to be a double-edged sword however, and once he enrolled to serve a term in the MAF as part of a local cadre battalion, he attracted the attentions of a noblewoman officer who was very, very interested in him. He did not reciprocate, and that's when the trouble started. He was caught in a catch-22; fraternizing with an officer was a punishable offense, but he didn't have the right to turn down a noblewoman. Instead of remaining trapped in the situation, he fled, schmoozing his way onto a cargo dropship and offworld the first chance he got. Now he stays on the move, preferring to contract with mercenaries who stay clear of the Magistracy and the trouble he left behind. He's since developed an introverted personality, and is a quiet, asocial sort. He gets uncomfortable in crowds, and prefers the solace of his cabin when not in the cockpit of a 'Mech.",
