    "Details": "There’s a normal life, then there’s an extraordinary life. Then of course there’s a miserable life. And then there’s Freakshow’s life, which there isn’t enough time or alcohol to sit through in one telling. We’re going to have to do this in bullet points, basically.\r\n\r\nFreakshow was born; we know that much, probably. He grew up among the folk of one of the many traveling Canopian circuses that made the rounds in the Rimward Periphery, bringing merriment, debauchery, and just a little weirdness to worlds both rich and poor. He says he got his first tattoo at eight. It’s a cartoon elephant. He’ll show you sometime. At some point when he was a teenager he discovered that he was both a glutton for punishment and enjoyed fighting. A lot. For both. Then came the piercings, and the torn-out piercings, and the bruises and broken noses and knocked-out teeth. Swishing with whiskey to disinfect after losing an incisor lead him to realize how much he liked whiskey too. And then there were pirates. He liked those guys, so he ran away with them. Yes, he ran away FROM the circus. Because of course he did. He’s Freakshow.\r\n\r\nWhile with the pirates he discovered how much more he liked drinking and fighting and tattoos and piercings and having piercings torn out and cartoon elephants and he added women and boxing for cash to that list. Then he added boxing in ‘Mechs to that list, because after a raid went south, the crew needed someone to step up and pilot the barely-functioning Javelin that they’d mostly scraped clean after said spoiled job. It was then that Freakshow discovered he piloted better drunk, because neurohelmets gave him a headache, and he loved to scrap toe-to-toe with other Battlemech pilots. So that’s what he does now. His crew all died except him and a few other stragglers, so he hires himself out as a ‘distraction’. We’ll leave you to decide what that actually means.",
