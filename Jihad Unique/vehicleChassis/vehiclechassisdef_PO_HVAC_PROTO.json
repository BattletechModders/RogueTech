    "Details": "This version of the Po uses experimental Hardened Armor for protection. The standard weaponry has been replaced with a Streak SRM-6 launcher and a Hypervelocity Autocannon/10. To maintain the tank's top speed designers had to use a Fusion Engine. While often derided as a poor man's Rommel/Patton tank, the simply constructed and dependable Po Heavy Tank, named by Romano Liao for the mischievous and vengeful spirit of Chinese tradition, has become the principal combat vehicle on Capellan worlds lacking 'Mech units. Introduced in 3031, the Po is built around the rugged, dependable, and cheap Ceres 240 internal combustion engine, which gives the tank a maximum flank speed of 65 kph. Ten and half tons of armor provides respectable protection for a heavy tank. Along with its ease of maintenance and decent firepower, this protection has made the Po a popular choice among cash strapped mercenaries, lower ranked garrison units, the Free Worlds League and Word of Blake, with such export sales keeping much needed funds flowing into the Confederation's coffers.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 4/6 Hex: 120/180 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Hardened\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       125     30\n<b>Left</b>          80     30\n<b>Right</b>        80     30\n<b>Rear</b>         75     30\n<b>Turret</b>      104     30\n\n<b>Total</b>      464    150\n</color>",
