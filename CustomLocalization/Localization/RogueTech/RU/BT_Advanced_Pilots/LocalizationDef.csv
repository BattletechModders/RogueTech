Diego never saw the old man die, as he paid passage as soon as he could to Outreach, to find adventure and glory. Unsurprisingly, the headstrong, naive young man lost his ‘Mech, and finally, his misplaced pride. Life had slapped him in the face, and now that his eyes were open to reality, he felt humble, and wished for nothing more than to actually earn himself a spot among a real Mercenary command, and a chance to really earn that which was unfairly bought.";"There are those who grow up knowing what it means to want, and then there are those as blessed as Diego Velazquez.

From this came her obession with Battlemechs, and combining them with music and dance to create something she thought would take the Inner Sphere by storm; to see a choreographed show of nimble 'Mechs set to music of her own production. It couldn't lose. Her devotion to the idea drove her though school, and into the ranks of the nearby Regional Training Battalion, where she hoped to gain the skills needed to bring her to center stage, and make her a star. And it might have happened had she not been caught utilizing Davion property practicing her routine, nevermind being the ringleader of a small group of cadets she'd schmoozed into working with her, promising them a share of the spotlight. It was too much for her commanding officers, and so she was summarily discharged. With few prospects, and no saftey net, she hitched rides on whatever dropships and jumpships she could till her journey unceremoniously plopped her in the Periphery, and opened her eyes to the potential for a second chance. All she had to to was find some bleeding heart who'd support her vision; for a cut of the profits and a share of the limelight, of course. But only a share.

Sometimes their options are limited due to the circumstances of their birth. Annabelle Geates was born in the officer’s quarters of a Leopard-class dropship, en route between worlds in the Free World’s League. Her mother was the CO of a mercenary group; her father a pilot. They had been trying to get to a proper hospital, but the trip from the jump point in-system was a long one, and Annabelle ended up being born a few days early. Her entire childhood was spent aboard the ship, with the crew and techs and pilots being her aunts and uncles. She learned about PPCs, and about KF drives, and jump jets, and tactics.

There he excelled in his tactics classes and was put on a fast track for being assigned to a line unit to replace the ever increasing losses during the 3rd Succession War.

"pilot_jk_Haree.Description.Details";"Originally a ground-pounder NCO for a support unit in the 2nd Robinson Rangers, Paul was stationed on Breed for garrison duty, along with an up-and-coming mercenary unit called the Steel Jaguars.  Part of what made the Jaguars stand out was their rigorous training regimen which involved a lot of wargames.  During the time stationed on Breed, the Rangers and Jaguars participate in multiple exercises, at first pitting each unit against each other and later performing mixed unit operations.  It was during one of these exercises that Paul's life would take an unexpected turn.\r\n\r\nDuring an exercise, Paul's Company lost their Command Squad, but he was unwilling to concede defeat and Paul organized a trap to even the score.  Luring the Jaguar scout lance into a geothermal valley, Paul's squad signaled the mock trigger for his unit's SRM Inferno rounds, which had been placed along the most likely trail the OpFor lance would take - the combination heat overload of the geysers and Infernos shut down 3 of the 4 'Mechs, with the final 'Mech being dispatched with overlapping fire from Paul's 2 remaining squads.  The mercenary Command staff were so impressed with Paul that their CO, Doyle, offered him a billet in the Steel Jaguars when his tour with the Rangers was complete.  It was at this point that he took on the nickname Haree, some say it is because no mater how hairy the situation gets, he can turn it around and make it hairier for the enemy.\r\n\r\nDespite having very little BattleMech experience, Haree joined up with the Jaguars a year later and quickly adapted to the life of a MechWarrior.  His natural combat and leadership abilities helping to propel him through the ranks and it seemed like Haree had barely moved into his locker before he was granted command of a scout lance and then the company, which was expedited somewhat by his predecessor taking an AC/10 round through the cockpit.\r\n\r\nUnder Haree's guidance, he helped the Steel Jaguar Battalion become one of the premiere units to hire if you absolutely had to get the job done.  During his tenure as Captain his company had failed a contract only once, just prior to Haree retiring his mantle.

Part of what made the Jaguars stand out was their rigorous training regimen which involved a lot of wargames.  During the time stationed on Breed, the Rangers and Jaguars participate in multiple exercises, at first pitting each unit against each other and later performing mixed unit operations.  It was during one of these exercises that Paul's life would take an unexpected turn.

During an exercise, Paul's Company lost their Command Squad, but he was unwilling to concede defeat and Paul organized a trap to even the score.  Luring the Jaguar scout lance into a geothermal valley, Paul's squad signaled the mock trigger for his unit's SRM Inferno rounds, which had been placed along the most likely trail the OpFor lance would take - the combination heat overload of the geysers and Infernos shut down 3 of the 4 'Mechs, with the final 'Mech being dispatched with overlapping fire from Paul's 2 remaining squads.  The mercenary Command staff were so impressed with Paul that their CO, Doyle, offered him a billet in the Steel Jaguars when his tour with the Rangers was complete.  It was at this point that he took on the nickname Haree, some say it is because no mater how hairy the situation gets, he can turn it around and make it hairier for the enemy.

Despite having very little BattleMech experience, Haree joined up with the Jaguars a year later and quickly adapted to the life of a MechWarrior.  His natural combat and leadership abilities helping to propel him through the ranks and it seemed like Haree had barely moved into his locker before he was granted command of a scout lance and then the company, which was expedited somewhat by his predecessor taking an AC/10 round through the cockpit.
