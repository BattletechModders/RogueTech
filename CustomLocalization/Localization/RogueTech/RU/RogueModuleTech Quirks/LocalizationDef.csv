Command Consoles are components that can only be mounted on Heavy or Assault Class 'Mechs. The Console adds a complete set of controls for a second MechWarrior with added command and control facilities, allowing for better Lance coordination by upgrading initiative.
 
 Star League-vintage Command Consoles are very rare by 3025 because 'Mechs equipped in this way were favoured targets in battle. Most still existing have been relegated to training duties.";;"#000000";"#FF0000"
