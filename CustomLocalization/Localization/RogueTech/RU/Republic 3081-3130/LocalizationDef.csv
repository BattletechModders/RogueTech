The 'Mech would become primarily used by Clans Jade Falcon and Hell's Horses in 3145, where the 'Mech would see action during those Clans' invasions of the Inner Sphere powers such as the Republic of the Sphere and Lyran Commonwealth. A noted action that utilized the Loki was during the Jade Falcon's occupation of Sargasso in 3142. The 9th Talon deployed a binary of Lokis to suppress resistance in the city of Salicastrum. The Cluster's Lokis (fitted with B Configurations) used their Long Tom Cannons to blast rebel forces. However, a Nova of Wolf-In-Exiles forces ambushed the binary, and the ensuing battle rendered half the Jade Falcon Lokis destroyed, however the survivors would withdraw temporarily. A Star's worth of survivors from the 9th would return to force a Clan Wolf retreat and prevent the world from falling back into Commonwealth hands.

A product of House Kurita's hidden efforts to rebuild its decimated 'Mech regiments, the Tenshi was designed to use resources found within the Combine. The Tenshi was first deployed among the ranks of the Ghost Regiments in the early 3100s, its deployment with a less-renowned brigade was part of the DCMS' two-fold effort of testing the 'Mech while also providing a fire-wall to save face should the design prove to be a failure in combat. One of its first deployments was in 3103, when the 1st Ghost conducted a raid on the Ghost Bear Dominionworld of Grumium. The eight Tenshis among the Ghosts' ranks performed well, with most of their numbers returning to the Combine with stolen Clan technology. Among the Tenshi's design features is its durability and having a heavy equipment payload. The designers saw fit to equip the 'Mech with a Compact Gyro and 18.5 tons of Standard Armor. The Tenshi also uses a number of new technologies that had finally entered production in the decades preceding the Jihad. The use of an Endo-Composite internal structure and a Light Fusion Engine granted the design a huge pod capacity of 48 tons. However, this large capacity had come at a price; that price being a slightly lower maximum speed than other comparable designs of the era.""
