Three ATM 6s, along with four tons of ammunition, give the design great flexibility at all ranges. A single ER Large Laser allows the 'Mech to stay in the fight in the event its ammunition bins have run dry.

      "content": "Первый экземпляр Copperhead выпущен в конце осени 3054 года, как мех специально предназначенный для боёв на арене. Эта модель меха получила известность когда Брендон Фрейзер мехвоин из Silver Dragons Stables вывел свой, Copperhead «Серебряный змей», в первую двадцатку топа Соляриса, перед тем как скоропостижно погибнуть. Silver Dragons заказали Solaris Arms разработать новый эксклюзивный вариант, чтобы вновь попытаться повторить подвиг Брендона, но наличие дорогостоящего экспериментального вооружения на новой модели вынудило их разрешить открытую продажу другим заинтересованным лицам. Подразделение Синдиката Дракона Mustered Soldiery закупило несколько оригинальных моделей CPR-HD-002. Оставив скудные четыре с половиной тонны брони от оригинальной модели, Solaris Arms решили заменить ферроволоконную обшивку от Durallex на отражающую броню ArcShield, что бы повысить ее сопротивляемость от большого объёма энергетического урона, наносимого мехами на арене. Установка Supercharger на достаточно быстрое шасси, значительно увеличило скоростные показатели меха.

Эта модель меха получила известность когда Брендон Фрейзер мехвоин из Silver Dragons Stables вывел свой, Copperhead «Серебряный змей», в первую двадцатку топа Соляриса, перед тем как скоропостижно погибнуть. Silver Dragons заказали Solaris Arms разработать новый эксклюзивный вариант, чтобы вновь попытаться повторить подвиг Брендона, но наличие дорогостоящего экспериментального вооружения на новой модели вынудило их разрешить открытую продажу другим заинтересованным лицам.

The New Avalon Institute of Science was the first to reproduce in part the Clans' Elemental armor as the Inner Sphere Standard.\n \n <b><color=#e62e00>Склонность: Stealth</color></b>\n \n <b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 0.94</color></b>",

While initially pleased to have a then Terran Hegemony controlled factory manufacturing the 'Mech exclusively for the LCAF, the Lyrans were less so when a Star League Council amendment in 2652 permitted the Star League Defense Force to purchase a highly advanced version of the design which Houses Steiner, Marik and Davion would not receive until years later. The Sentinel was one of many designs to suffer from the technological decline of the Succession Wars era, with Defiance first losing the ability to manufacture its advanced weapon systems before discontinuing production entirely in 3014 due to lack of both parts and interest.

Noting the loss of many Arrow IV equipped units and the slaughter of their crews during Clan breakthroughs, the Maverick Industries design teams looked for ways to improve the situation. With a license to produce the Hollander BZK-F3 already secured, it was decided to produce an upgraded model that utilised an XL Engine to mount the Arrow IV launcher.
