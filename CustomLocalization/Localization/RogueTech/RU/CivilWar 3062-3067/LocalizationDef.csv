Noting the loss of many Arrow IV equipped units and the slaughter of their crews during Clan breakthroughs, the Maverick Industries design teams looked for ways to improve the situation. With a license to produce the Hollander BZK-F3 already secured, it was decided to produce an upgraded model that utilised an XL Engine to mount the Arrow IV launcher. Modern artillery tactics called for the deployment of anti air and anti mech units to protect the precious assets, so Maverick only mounted a Small Pulse Laser on the mech, augmented by a TAG; so that the Hollander could handle infantry infiltrators and spot for either it’s own launcher or the rest of it’s lancemates. The designs speed was judged sufficient for it to evade other threats that might threaten the mech, especially with it’s armour unable to stand up to much punishment. \n \n <b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Stable Weapons</color></b>\n \n <b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.05</color></b>\n----\nProduced by Maverick Industries after Operations Serpent and Bulldog, the TsarBomba is an attempt to improve the flexibility and survivability of artillery units.

Its focus is also short range, as evidenced by twin Ultra Autocannon/20s. Six tons of ammunition is adequate, though only barely. Three ATM 6s, along with four tons of ammunition, give the design great flexibility at all ranges. A single ER Large Laser allows the 'Mech to stay in the fight in the event its ammunition bins have run dry. Seventeen double heat sinks are unequal to the task assigned them.

Эта модель меха получила известность когда Брендон Фрейзер мехвоин из Silver Dragons Stables вывел свой, Copperhead «Серебряный змей», в первую двадцатку топа Соляриса, перед тем как скоропостижно погибнуть. Silver Dragons заказали Solaris Arms разработать новый эксклюзивный вариант, чтобы вновь попытаться повторить подвиг Брендона, но наличие дорогостоящего экспериментального вооружения на новой модели вынудило их разрешить открытую продажу другим заинтересованным лицам. Подразделение Синдиката Дракона Mustered Soldiery закупило несколько оригинальных моделей CPR-HD-002. Оставив скудные четыре с половиной тонны брони от оригинальной модели, Solaris Arms решили заменить ферроволоконную обшивку от Durallex на отражающую броню ArcShield, что бы повысить ее сопротивляемость от большого объёма энергетического урона, наносимого мехами на арене. Установка Supercharger на достаточно быстрое шасси, значительно увеличило скоростные показатели меха. Недостаток низкой дальности прыжка не был устранён или улучшен, вместо этого он был сохранен, чтобы расширить возможности пилотирования на труднопроходимой местности.

"mechdef_copperhead_CPR-HD-004.Description.Details";"First produced in late fall of 3054, the Copperhead is a finely honed arena 'Mech. The design rose to fame when Silver Dragons Stables MechWarrior Brendon Frazer piloted his Copperhead, the Silver Snake, into the Solaris Top Twenty prior to his untimely death. The Silver Dragons commissioned Solaris Arms to develop a new exclusive variant to try and repeat the feat, but the new model's expensive experimental weaponry forced them to allow sales to other interested parties. The Draconis Combine Mustered Soldiery snapped up a number of the original CPR-HD-002 models. While not increasing the original model's meager four and half tons of armor coverage, Solaris Arms chose to replace the original Durallex plating with ArcShield Reflective Armor to enhance its endurance against the large volume of energy weapons carried by Arena 'Mechs. Already a relatively speedy design, the addition of a Supercharger enhanced its ground speed. Its extremely short jumping distance was neither improved nor removed; instead it was retained to expand a pilot's options in tight terrain. An extra Double Heat Sink, bringing the total to thirteen, is still not enough to keep up with the increased heat produced by the CPR-HD-003's advanced laser weaponry.

Эта модель меха получила известность когда Брендон Фрейзер мехвоин из Silver Dragons Stables вывел свой, Copperhead «Серебряный змей», в первую двадцатку топа Соляриса, перед тем как скоропостижно погибнуть. Silver Dragons заказали Solaris Arms разработать новый эксклюзивный вариант, чтобы вновь попытаться повторить подвиг Брендона, но наличие дорогостоящего экспериментального вооружения на новой модели вынудило их разрешить открытую продажу другим заинтересованным лицам. Подразделение Синдиката Дракона Mustered Soldiery закупило несколько оригинальных моделей CPR-HD-002. Оставив скудные четыре с половиной тонны брони от оригинальной модели, Solaris Arms решили заменить ферроволоконную обшивку от Durallex на отражающую броню ArcShield, что бы повысить ее сопротивляемость от большого объёма энергетического урона, наносимого мехами на арене.

By September of that year, a few prototypes had been built and were being tested in trial runs. One these prototypes was piloted by Nathan Wolf in a Circle of Equals on Tamar when he attained the rank of Star Colonel. Although he was victorious against a Thor, it was noted that the Tomahawk still suffered from numerous system errors and gremlins and was not yet ready for mass production. Still, Nathan retained the 'Mech for his subsequent assignment to Omega Galaxy and successfully piloted it in combat on Novo Cressidas in the Star's End system on 11 April 3064.

"vehicledef_ENYO_CLAN.Description.Details";"The Enyo Strike Tank is a combat vehicle produced by Clan Hell's Horses. Following the success of the XL Engine variant of the Mars, Khan Malavai Fletcher ordered his scientist caste to come up with a main battle tank that could take advantage of the speed a lightweight engine could bring. His successor, James Cobb, liked the idea and maintained the mandate for such a proof of concept. The result of the scientists' labor is the Enyo. It can hit speeds up to 97 km/h, which enables it to keep up with many Clan medium 'Mechs.
