"chassisdef_ostscout_OTT-11J.Description.Details";"The Ostscout was designed as a pure recon BattleMech by Ostmann Industries. To that end, it was built entirely around gathering data and getting out of trouble, tasks for which it is exceptional.

However its ability to run and leap out of danger came at the expense of offensive capability.

As it is, the Ostcout would be hard-pressed to win a fight against all but the lightest 'Mechs.

Besides the Great Houses, ComStar also utilized the Ostscout, and in the aftermath of the Clan Invasion and ComStar Schism began developing a new Ostscout variant for their Com Guards. This new model would maintain the same maneuverability and intelligence-gathering capabilities of the original while improving its offensive and defensive capabilities. Debuting with success in 3064, within the next three years nearly half of all Com Guard Ostscouts had been upgraded to the new variant; however it was soon discovered that both the Lyran Alliance and Word of Blake were fielding their own updated Ostscouts identical to ComStar's.

This similarity prompted more than a few FWLM technicians to nickname the new design the Omni-Orion and the deployment of Perseus has largely been to front-line units that fielded large concentrations of its progenitor, replacing older Orions on a one-for-one basis. Built on a lightweight Endo Steel chassis, the Perseus is powered by a Hermes 300 XL engine helping save even more weight and giving the 'Mech a top speed of 64.8 km/h. The advanced structure and engine save a great deal of weight for weapons and equipment. The Perseus is protected by fourteen tons of Valiant Lamellor armor, giving it around average armor protection for a 'Mech of its size. It also has twelve double heat sinks that are fixed on the chassis.

"mechdef_cossack_C-1FC.Description.Details";"The Cossack is named after the mercenary unit Khorsakov's Cossacks in honor of their faithful service to the St Ives Compact. The Cossack is a practice in compromise. Originally requested as the fastest 'Mech that Ceres Metals Industries could produce, the emphasis of the design changed throughout its development to a slow moving, heavily armored light 'Mech. The final design that was accepted became the current incarnation of the Cossack. The Cossack is built on a Taijian Series X Endo Steel chassis to save weight. More weight was cut from the design by using a lightweight Hermes 120 XL engine that gives the 'Mech a top speed of 97.2 km/h. Six Pitban LFT-65 jump jets allow the Cossack to jump up to hundred and eighty meters, allowing the 'Mech to easily handle most rough terrain. For protection, the Cossack has three tons of armor and has ten heat sinks to handle the heat produced by the weapons payload carried by the 'Mech.

The increased weight of the engine required stripping out the weapons and reducing the armor protection from the levels of the 500-D, even with the inclusion of Heavy Ferro-Fibrous armor. It is armed only with a Light Autocannon/2 that is fed by a single CASE-protected bin, limiting the ability of the autocannon to use special munitions. The 900-D was only in the prototype stage when the Word of Blake attacked Coventry. Afterwards it could be found in service with the Word of Blake Militia.

"mechdef_ostscout_OTT-11J.Description.Details";"The Ostscout was designed as a pure recon BattleMech by Ostmann Industries. To that end, it was built entirely around gathering data and getting out of trouble, tasks for which it is exceptional. The Ostscout is quick enough to escape most traps, and very few other designs can match it in terms of speed and maneuverability. However its ability to run and leap out of danger came at the expense of offensive capability. In fact were it not for aggressive lobbying on the part of its test pilots the final production model would have been completely weaponless. As it is, the Ostcout would be hard-pressed to win a fight against all but the lightest 'Mechs. A poor combatant, the 'Mech excels at operating deep behind enemy lines, gathering as much information as possible about the terrain and the disposition of enemy forces. Besides the Great Houses, ComStar also utilized the Ostscout, and in the aftermath of the Clan Invasion and ComStar Schism began developing a new Ostscout variant for their Com Guards. This new model would maintain the same maneuverability and intelligence-gathering capabilities of the original while improving its offensive and defensive capabilities. Debuting with success in 3064, within the next three years nearly half of all Com Guard Ostscouts had been upgraded to the new variant; however it was soon discovered that both the Lyran Alliance and Word of Blake were fielding their own updated Ostscouts identical to ComStar's. The intelligence leak would be confirmed and traced back to Dag Kesselring, former Precentor of the 66th Division, who passed on information about the program to both the Lyrans and Blakists.\n \n <b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Improved Sensors</color></b>\n \n <b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.05</color></b>\n----\nThe Ostscout was designed as a pure recon BattleMech by Ostmann Industries.
