      "content": "Every month, {TEAM_TAR.FactionDef.Name} sends out another supply convoy loaded with military hardware and valuable electronics. They guard it heavily, so we're not asking you to hit the main force; no sense in throwing away good mercenaries. Instead we want you to pick off the tail end of the convoy. The cargo isn't as valuable as what they send out in the vanguard, but it won't be as heavily defended. Take the convoy out, and we'll send in our people to grab whatever's still intact. We don't really want to get shot at, so we'll pay a bonus if you take out all the defenders, as well.",
