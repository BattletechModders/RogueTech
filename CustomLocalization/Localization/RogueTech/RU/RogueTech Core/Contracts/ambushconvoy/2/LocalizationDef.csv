"AmbushConvoy_ThornInTheSide_Alt.shortDescription";"The {TEAM_TAR.FactionDef.Demonym} control of this world is nearly absolute. We've identified a point of vulnerability, however: they move supplies and weapons by convoy, and those convoys are lightly defended by a single lance of 'Mechs. If we destroy enough of their supply convoys, their other operations will be weakened enough for our forces to move in and take advantage of their fragility. We don't want to tip our hand, however, so we'd like you to engage in a little guerilla warfare on our behalf.";"The {TEAM_TAR.FactionDef.Demonym} control of this world is nearly absolute.
