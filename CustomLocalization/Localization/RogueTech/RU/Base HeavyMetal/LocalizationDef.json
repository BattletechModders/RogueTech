      "content": "The 5S variant of the Archer, built out of Defiance Industries' massive Hesperus II complex in 3050, was the official variant for the Armed Forces of the Federated Commonwealth. The 5S upgraded the engine to an Edasich Motors 280 XL Engine, cutting the engine's weight in half while retaining the same speed profile. The 5S also reduced the LRM-20 launchers to LRM-15s. This saved weight was used to add two Coventry T4H Streak SRM-2 launchers, one in each arm and fed by two tons of reloads in the side torsos. They also upgraded the four medium lasers to Medium Pulse Lasers. Finally, the 'Mech carried a Doering Electronics Glowworm Narc Missile Beacon launcher in its left torso along with one ton of ammo. This allowed the Archer to tag enemy units with a beacon so that friendly 'Mechs could more easily hit the unit with their own missile weapons. All of the ammunition carried by the 5S was protected by CASE.",

Capable of dispersing riots with lethal and non lethal options, it works well against civilians and lightly armed vehicles while posing no significant threat to actual battlemechs or military grade vehicles. Dual grenade launchers and a mixed laser package provide the bulk of the firepower, whilst a pair of flare launchers provides additional deterrent and can be used defensively in combat. Spall lined armour provides additional protection against infantry grade weapons and a set of sensors designed specifically for peering through cluttered urban environments round out the package. Often deployed as scouts and support forces; this mech is a common sight amongst the pirate bands who find themselves facing it across the battlefield.

High Grade Ferro-Fibrous armor. The primary weapon on the 'Mech was a Thunderbolt-12 Large Pulse Laser built into the right arm, though it still retained the two medium lasers and machine guns of the original. Additionally an anti-missile system was mounted on the right arm, with its two tons of ammo (along with two tons of machine gun ammo) protected by CASE in the left torso.

Based on the earlier 4D, it replaces the PPCs with ER PPC models and restores the original model's medium lasers to the side torsos. A 240-rated XL engine was used to free up weight for the mounting of seventeen double heat sinks and an increase in armor protection to nine tons. Production of this model was taken up by Kallon Industries on Talon, Trellshire Industires on Twycross and Red Devil Industries on Pandora.",

Spall lined armour provides additional protection against infantry grade weapons and a set of sensors designed specifically for peering through cluttered urban environments round out the package. Often deployed as scouts and support forces; this mech is a common sight amongst the pirate bands who find themselves facing it across the battlefield. Not designed for battle, it is nonetheless pressed into service by desperate militias and governments that lack real battlemechs.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Склонность: Improved Lifesupport</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 0.97</color></b>",
