    "Details": "The Pike was created at the direction of Magestrix Kyalla Centrella of the Magistracy of Canopus during the later part of the Third Succession War. Her plan was to produce an inexpensive combat vehicle so the Great Houses would wear down their BattleMech armies through attrition, and the Pike would be the tool she envisioned for the task. However, sending vehicles to market in the Inner Sphere was to be more costly than anticipated. With the Great Houses' shrinking numbers of ships in their JumpShip fleets, the vehicle did not make the impact she had hoped it would. It became a favorite of ComStar's growing garrison forces for their HPG complexes.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Fuel Cell: Improved vehicle engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 3/5 Hex: 90/150 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Ferro-Fibrous\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       210     30\n<b>Left</b>         190     30\n<b>Right</b>       190     30\n<b>Rear</b>        170     30\n<b>Turret</b>      210     30\n\n<b>Total</b>      970    150\n</color>",
