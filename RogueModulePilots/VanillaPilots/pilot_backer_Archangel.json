    "Details": "A strange illness emptied the lance of damaged Battlemechs seeking refuge at the small, peaceful mining town of X, and superstitious fear kept them empty for years. But when raiders came, four young boys who'd been playing around the 'Mechs for years climbed into them to defend their home. They failed, of course, but the impressed leader of the raiders took the 'Mechs instead of their lives, and left their community enough to rebuild with.\r\n\r\nSome kids would have taken that defeat hard, but not Archangel. He rallied his friends and came up with a plan. When the raiders came back a few years later for another 'harvest', Archangel and his team were ready. They didn't have BattleMechs, but they had mining equipment, Agromechs, and a whole lot of time to practice.\r\n\r\nThey still lost, but they did no worse than they'd done with Battlemechs, and with far inferior equipment. That time, the leader of the raiders left the equipment, and took the young men. She split them among her ships, and Archangel hasn't seen his friends since. He wasn't the most malleable of recruits, but the raider leader had a gift for redirecting his fury and putting his stubborn recklessness to good use.\r\n\r\nEventually, just prior to her retirement, the leader kicked him out of her gang, telling him he'd be better off in a proper mercenary crew with somebody who could both point him in the best direction, and yank his balls out of the fire just in case Plan A failed, failed again, and failed a third time. It turned out she was correct. In the right team, Archangel is amazing.\r\n\r\nThese days, he's starting to miss his old town, and wondering if it or a place like it needs somebody to protect it. Somebody who will never give up; somebody like him.",
