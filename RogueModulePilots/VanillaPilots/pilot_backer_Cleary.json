    "Details": "Kenrik was born on Bellevue in the Federated Suns, to parents who were executed promptly after his birth for failing to keep oaths made to a local crime lord. Kenrik himself was adopted into the crime lord's extensive 'family,' and from his earliest years was employed doing 'errands' for the family matriarch.\r\n\r\nAs he grew, so did his 'family.' By the time he was an adult, they were a 'syndicate,' and he was running smuggling operations between cities, escorting the convoys in a BattleMech that had been 'adopted' just like him. Eventually, a long-term investigation fingered him, and the family matriarch shipped him off-planet to Solaris VII, to protect him as well as herself.\r\n\r\nOn Solaris VII, under instructions to create a new identity for himself, he settled into training to join a gladiatorial stable. While there, he dueled and defeated a spunky younger pilot who quickly decided he was her new mentor. When he received word from Bellevue that it was time for him to move on from Solaris VII, the kid followed him all the way out to the Periphery.\r\n\r\nIntermittently, they work together now. When they aren't on the same contracts, he answers her mail. Occasionally. Sometimes. But the letters from Bellevue telling him he can come home again, those, he ignores.",
