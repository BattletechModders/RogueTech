    "Details": "Todd Stevenson grew up in his father's shipping fleet on the edge of the Free Worlds League, learning how to shine up old tech so it looked—and hopefully worked— like new. He also learned the importance of making sure you always got something out of every deal. When a government crackdown confiscated his father's fleet in lieu of back taxes, and his father simply accepted it, Todd rebelled.\r\n\r\nStealing one of his father's ships, he continued trading, now doing smuggling for the black market. Fearless and boastful, he accepted all the riskiest runs — and on one of them, he struck gold. On a moon well off established trade routes, he found a derelict military dropship, with several trashed Battlemechs in the bay. He spent several years piecing together the equipment and learning how to use it. A number of ill-advised decisions during that time meant that eventually a coalition of dissatisfied customers tracked him down — and he was only able to buy his life with his makeshift 'Mech. And the way he tells it, it almost certainly fell apart the first time somebody other than him tried to fire its weapons.\r\n\r\nHis reputation as a black market trader in shreds, he made his way to the Periphery, to look for whatever work he could get. He now gets work as a junior MechTech or a 'Mech pilot, whichever his employers need. His equipment is always very, <i>very</i> shiny.",
