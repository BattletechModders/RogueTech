    "Details": "Growing up on a Periphery planet repeatedly ransacked during the latter stages of the Third Succession War, Matthew Osis acquired an unusual taste for violence. He was adopted from the ruins of his home by the commander of passing mercenary company. Seeing unusual potential in the boy, his proclivities were encouraged and indulged by his protector, right up until there was a mutiny and fourteen year old Matthew was abandoned once again.\r\n\r\nHe spent two years working his way across the Periphery, keeping his tendency toward violence in check until he finally arrived at Solaris VII â€”the destination his mentor had been aiming him toward all along. There he found one of the least respected gladiatorial stables and promised them that if they put him in a 'Mech, he'd take them to the top. Such was the force of his personality that they did. He kept his word.\r\n\r\nWhile he wasn't as showy as some of the champions, and he didn't have crowd-pleasing manners, excellence has its own charm, and savagery creates its own reputation. For fifteen years, he dominated one-on-one arenas, until eventually his stable had trouble finding opponents for him to fight. As part of a long-term strategy to set up an explosive comeback fight, Matthew's manager convinced him to take an extended sabbatical from the ring. Now, unable to relax unless he's fought something recently, Matthew is working as a mercenary in the Periphery. If baring his teeth counts as a smile, he smiles every time somebody recognizes his name\n\n <b><color=#00ffff>Can Command Tanks and Pilot Mechs.</color></b>",
