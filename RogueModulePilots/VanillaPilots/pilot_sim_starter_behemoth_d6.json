At eighteen, she signed up with a small-time mercenary company to feed her growing wanderlust. Miranda went undefeated in her crew's drinking games - and in the brawling that usually followed. When her fellow mercenaries turned to piracy, she was in. When they turned over a new leaf, she was out, and looking for a tougher crew\n\n <b><color=#00ffff>Can Command Tanks and Pilot Mechs.</color></b>",
