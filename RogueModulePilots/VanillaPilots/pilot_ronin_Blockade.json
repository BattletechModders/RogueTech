    "Details": "Ellis Simonsen was born and raised on a space station orbiting Coromodir 5, the only child of a team of engineers who decided to have a child as a bonding exercise. It was, he freely admits, a weird childhood. He managed to develop a completely normal personality, with good metrics in every field that mattered and his parents are still patting themselves on the back about that twenty years later.\r\n\r\nHe went to a military academy on Coromodir 6, and after graduation pursued further schooling before joining the Royal Guard. There, he quickly became a popular lieutenant due to his mild personality, dependable nature and general patience. Unfortunately, in 3022, a new commanding officer made the mistake of assuming all those positive traits meant he would blindly obey illegal orders.\r\n\r\nAfter incapacitating his commanding officer, he directed his command in the defense of House Arano until it was clear there was no immediate hope in that regard. He then saw to his command's safety before escaping off-world. Now, he works as a mercenary while monitoring the Aurigan situation, waiting for a chance to once again honor his oaths to House Arano.",
