    "Details": "Llana Huxley was raised to be loyal to her planet of New Hessen, rather the the Capellan Confederation that claimed it. Her wealthy father was a 'Mech enthusiast who volunteered his own BattleMech for local militia use. From age 8 she rode with him in the cockpit, becoming an informal mascot for the militia. But as she grew, her role as mascot worked against her. She wanted to be taken seriously as a future leader of the militia, but despite their affection, her seniors gave her no credit for actual ability.\r\n\r\nSo Llana tried to prove herself through enlistment. But her first deployment was more than she bargained for, and a part of her simply broke. During what she would later recall as the darkest time of her life, Llana joined other deserters from her unit on an interplanetary crime spree. It wasn't until her father personally tracked her down and confronted her that she started coming to terms with what she'd done and what she was willing to do.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to turn herself in to her original unit, but her father convinced her to come home again instead. She no longer had a legal identity in the Capellan Confederation, but her father's militia welcomed her anyhow. Once again she sat in the cockpit of a 'Mech, defending the home she loved â€” all the way up until her father died. Then the lawyers came for her father's 'Mech, and her continued existence was discovered. Once again, she wanted to stay and face her fate, but the militia members who had watched her grow up couldn't bear it, and forced her to flee her home. Now she wanders the Periphery, taking mercenary jobs and hoping to one day put together her own company that she can lead back to the defense of New Hessen\n\n <b><color=#00ffff>Can Command Tanks and Pilot Mechs.</color></b>",
