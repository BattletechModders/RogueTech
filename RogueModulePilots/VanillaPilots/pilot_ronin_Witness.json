    "Details": "Erin Sosa is the sole offspring of a Guldra space station deputy administrator of 'uncommon sense but no great genius' (in their own words), and it wasn't until Erin was nearly four years old that anybody suspected there was something unusual about the child. After young Erin broke a standardized aptitude testing program three times, their preschool counselor referred them to a planetside specialist. Erin's parent, who couldn't afford such things and felt that their child was just fine, declined at first to follow up. It wasn't until the counselor contacted the specialist and the specialist presented himself at Erin's parent's door that Erin's capabilities were properly evaluated.\r\n\r\nAfter that, Erin's childhood became a tug-of-war between their parent of uncommon sense and a bevy of interested other parties who wanted to stake an early claim to Erin's genius. It was impossible for Erin to be oblivious to this, but they adapted cheerfully to stressors that might have crushed another child. Erin's parent, who wanted above all to make sure their child grew up happy and healthy, refused to push their child in any particular direction. But when House Madeira got directly involved, it was impossible for Erin or their parent to resist. Erin's parent was granted a large honorarium and a dwelling planetside, and Erin themselves was fast-tracked into the most elite branch of the House Madeira Guard.\r\n\r\nAnd then Espinoza's coup happened. Like so many dispossessed loyalists, Erin Sosa is now working as a Periphery mercenary. Their parent is somewhere safe for now, and someday, perhaps they'll both get to go home again\n\n <b><color=#00ffff>Can Command Tanks and Pilot Mechs.</color></b>",
