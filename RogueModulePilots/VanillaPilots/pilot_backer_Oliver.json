    "Details": "Garrat Dardai was born on Erod's Escape in the Periphery years before its official colonization by Jacob Erod. His family was part of group of slaves from a pirate planet who had escaped on a stolen ship and stumbled onto the Escape's verdant lushness. Unfortunately his own parents had both died from disease by the time he was ten years old, and he was taken in by a local orphanage run by a man who had picked up his moral code from pirates.\r\n\r\nYoung Garrat spent his teenage and young adult years picking pockets, casing houses, and fleecing the occasional visitors to the Escape who stopped to resupply. It wasn't his preferred life and he often dreamed of escape, but could never work out a way out of his situationâ€¦until one day he messed with the wrong mercenary company. Or, from a long term perspective, the right one. After being caught red-handed stealing from the company, the commander had him thrown into their DropShip's brig and, once he was off planet, demanded he repay what he stole through hard labor. He did so, and so cheerfully that he was soon simply one of the crew. When his term with that company was up, he was free to make his own way in the Periphery, with plenty of legitimate skills to keep himself fed.",
