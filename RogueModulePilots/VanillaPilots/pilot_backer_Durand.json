    "Details": "Josh Durand started life in a rural town attached to a Federated Suns military base, the son of an enlisted man who'd mustered out early to settle down and raise a family. Josh was something of a problem child for his teachers, although he loved spending time with his family. While he achieved an adequate technical education, his heart was elsewhere, and he spent hours watching maneuvers at the military base.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was eligible, he enlisted. While school discipline had riled him, military discipline suited him. He immediately started on a Special Forces track as a communications officer, before eventually transitioning to ops and intelligence work.\r\n\r\nThen, as the needs of the military shifted, he underwent training to pilot BattleMechs. He served as a 'Mech pilot for the Federated Suns for five years, picking up the callsign 'Bullet Trap' for his preference for the front lines. The end of the Third Succession War saw him mustered out with all honors. While he welcomed a more peaceful era for his people and his family, he knew he could never adapt to such a life, so he headed to the Periphery to continue the work he enjoyed as a mercenary\n\n <b><color=#00ffff>Can Command Tanks and Pilot Mechs.</color></b>",
