    "Details": "Tane Bennett was born on the archipelago of Zangul, on one of the roving fleets that served as fishing villages for the planet's solitary starport city. He spent most of his childhood barefoot, learning to climb and jump and instinctively calculate odd angles. When he was nearly grown, he was 'banished' to the starport for complaining too much about fishing. There, he saw his first BattleMech and was thoroughly unimpressed by how big and awkward they were.\r\n\r\nIn the starport, his unique skills earned him unusual attention, and soon he was recruited by a mercenary company for a very particular form of covert operations. However, they neglected to properly indoctrinate him before unleashing him, and when the moment came for him to complete a particularly dishonorable assassination, he froze, fumbled, and fled.\r\n\r\nThat was years ago. He never returned to his original mercenary company, but there are plenty of others. While he initially disliked BattleMechs, he now finds solace in piloting one. It's a way of earning his keep that only reveals a face <i>still</i> on Wanted: dispatches to his mercenary teammates\n\n <b><color=#00ffff>Can Command Tanks and Pilot Mechs.</color></b>",
