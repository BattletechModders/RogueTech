    "Details": "Some people say the spores of the fungal planet Regis Roost instill the inhabitants with a less than serious outlook on life. If so, that isn't apparent in Aadya Mehra. For Aadya, life is stern and life is earnest. She worked very hard on Regis Roost, learning everything she was taught, taking it all seriously. She thought deeply about everything around her; she even read poetry, and, as a result, ran into walls a lot.\r\n\r\nThey put her in a 'Mech early as a result. It started as one of those Regis Roost jokes. But the child had a gift, and it did mean she got fewer bruises from running into things. Of course when she grew up, she looked for work as a mercenary. The regular military would have probably kicked her out the first week (or so said her uncles), so it had to be mercenaries if she wanted to get off Regis Roost. And she really, really did. There were other planets with things like <i>trees</i> out there!\r\n\r\nNow that she has some experience as a mercenary, 'Mockingbird' tries her best to set an example for rookie pilots, and to emulate the more mature ones… sometimes to her own embarrassment\n\n <b><color=#00ffff>Can Command Tanks and Pilot Mechs.</color></b>",
