    "Details": "\"Crime doesn't pay, Teo Navarro,\" said his mama. \"You just keep your head down and work hard and be glad we're in the Federated Suns and not in any of those other places.\" Crime doesn't pay… except when it does. Crime paid for his mama's heart surgery and his little sisters' schooling. Crime put food on the table when Mama couldn't get enough work and basic benefits were cut once again so the military could build yet more war machines.\r\n\r\nCrime does pay…. until you get caught. And even then, the House Davion military industrial complex wanted to <i>recruit</i> him, not punish him. That was what the Third Succession War had driven proud House Davion to.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to spit in their faces and accept the execution they offered him as an alternative. But would the criminal organization continue to take care of his family if he died for them? Sometimes they did, and sometimes they didn't. Best, he decided, to <i>appear</i> to die. To do what the Federated Suns asked him to do.\r\n\r\nSo he did, for a while. He tracked and brokered and assassinated. Until Mama died anyhow, at the bottom of an endless waiting list for another surgery. He walked away that night, collected his two youngest sisters and his orphaned nieces, and took them all out to the Periphery, away from the corrupt, treacherous Inner Sphere. Now, they live someplace safe. He still sends them most of the money he makes as a mercenary, and his kit is covered in photos of his family. The older ones are somber, but the younger ones smile. Mama would, finally, be proud\n\n <b><color=#00ffff>Can Command Tanks and Pilot Mechs.</color></b>",
