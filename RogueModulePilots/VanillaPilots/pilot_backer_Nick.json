    "Details": "The pilot called Christoph Nick came from… somewhere. Everybody comes from somewhere, after all. And the people he spent most of his time working with were particularly notorious for not giving a damn about somebody's past. He showed up one day on Tortuga Prime, and he knew his way around, and that was all that mattered.\r\n\r\nFor years, he worked in various pirate bands out of Tortuga, raiding and stealing, but refusing to enslave anybody. For him, being a pirate was about freedom, not power, and he had the skills to back up his point of view. As a result he had an antagonistic relationship with the ruler of Tortuga. He managed to avoid her intermittent assassination attempts and never came in direct conflict with her until he at last decided that life under Dame Trevaline no longer fit his ideals. In one very busy night, he freed two hundred slaves, stole three ships, and burned down four of Dame Trevaline's stashes… possibly all by himself.\r\n\r\nHe doesn't tell this story himself, of course. But the dregs of society in every port city recognize his name, and whispers surround him when he goes out for a drink. As for Christoph himself? He likes to stay on the move, and only works with mercenary companies without a fixed contract.",
