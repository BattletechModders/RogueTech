    "Details": "Peter Chang was born on Old Kentucky, in the Capellan Confederation, to an established family of skilled metalworkers. He preferred books to metallurgy and his supportive family encouraged him to work hard and attend a local vocational school after his militia training. When he graduated at the top of his class and was accepted into Sian University, they couldn't have been prouder.\r\n\r\nThey were less pleased when they realized he intended to study literature and philosophy rather than something useful, but Peter didn't care. Having achieved a place in academia, he fully intended to stay there. He underestimated the viciousness of the tenure track, though. Soon, via maneuverings only sketchily recorded, he was strongly encouraged to travel, and travel far.\r\n\r\nRelying on a small stipend provided in exchange for his silence, he explored the Inner Sphere and discovered that adventure was more to his taste than academia anyhow. On one journey, he found himself piloting a Marauder — and found that he was good at it. When he received word that his benefactor had died and his stipend would no longer be provided, he knew exactly what to do next: mercenary work, out in the Periphery.\r\n\r\nHe's something of a curiosity among MechWarriors, with his academic background and extensive civilian travels. But that very background makes him useful in a lance with more traditional MechWarriors, so he's found plenty of work since he first sat in that Marauder\n\n <b><color=#00ffff>Can Command Tanks and Pilot Mechs.</color></b>",
