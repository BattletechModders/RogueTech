    "Details": "Zachary Shiseo-Yen grew up as the foster son of his father's commanding officer in the Draconis Combine. He was one of many. Along with his foster brothers, he was enrolled in a special institute set up for the orphaned offspring of the Arm of the Dragon, and taught that the only way avenge his loss was with blood. He did not question, for it was all he knew.\r\n\r\nAs an infantryman deployed in support of BattleMech units, he displayed an unusual tenacity that earned the personal attention of one of the senior 'Mech pilots. Over the course of the following decade, the bond between the young soldier and the elder pilot grew, and as the MechWarrior was transferred between assignments, he made sure to bring his favorite foot soldier with him.\r\n\r\nIn time, at his mentor's request, Zachary was removed from the front lines and made the MechWarrior's personal aide and technician. He learned a great deal in this time, absorbing not only his mentor's piloting wisdom, but his jaded attitude about life in the Draconis Combine.\r\n\r\nAnd then, one day, his mentor died. It wasn't even an honorable death in battle, but in his sleep. While the death was declared to be heart failure, cohort opinion turned against Zachary. When his celebrated mentor had lived, nobody had dared express their jealousy over his status, but now that he was gone, that jealousy became suspicion and then outright accusations of murder.\r\n\r\nAs Zachary was trying to decide how to defend his honor and cope with his grief, he discovered a final message from his mentor ordering him to flee the Combine to find a new life. Zachary chose to obey that final order. Now he wanders the Periphery, putting to use everything he learned at his mentor's side, and hoping to once again find a place where he is valued.",
