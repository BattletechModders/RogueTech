    "Details": "For many, being born to the nobility of the Capellan Confederation means limitless possibilities, but for Abe Chung, it was only a burden. One of far, far too many cousins, his entire life was ordered for him and he was only ever looked at to be corrected.\r\n\r\nHe bore up patiently, barely meeting expectations, all the way through college, where he graduated at the bottom of his class with degrees in biology and engineering. Disgusted by his failure to excel, his family sent him far away, to a medical outpost on the edge of civilization, there to supervise doctors with far more passion than himself.\r\n\r\nBut away from the overbearing scrutiny of his lineage, in a place where even a useless over-educated petty noble sometimes had to drive a supply truck in a crisis, Abe blossomed. When a local conflict spilled into the hospital grounds and three BattleMechs stood pilotless, Abe did what had to be done.\r\n\r\nHis keen observational skills and strong sense of tactics carried that day, along with his borrowed 'Mech, but the conflict didn't stop there. Soon the entire medical outpost was shut down and its staff transferred elsewhere. Abe's family called him home, ready to take another look at what their disappointing young man had grown into. He didn't answer, instead choosing to vanish into the Periphery to make his own way as a mercenary 'Mech pilot.",
