    "Details": "Andaelas was born on Meacham in the Lyran Commonwealth, to parents who died in the endless conflict with the Draconis Combine before he could even be named. One of the many orphanages of Meacham took him in and he was given  the house name 'Alistair' for his own. Growing up, he was taught to be proud of his parents' sacrifice, and expected to follow in their footsteps when he came of age.\r\n\r\nWhen that day came, they conscripted him before he could volunteer. With poor equipment and very little training, he was sent to the Draconis Front, a meat grinder where his dedication to the Commonwealth was tested time and again. Mostly, it held.\r\n\r\nEverybody who survived was promoted, so as to inspire next batch of conscripts. But promotion just meant more challenges. Finally, his squadron of foot soldiers was thrown against a lance of BattleMechs without backup. When Andaelas climbed into a nearly crippled Catapult and turned its missiles on the enemy DropShip delivering yet more troops, he knew he could never go back to being a groundpounder again.\r\n\r\nHis loyalty to the Lyran Commonwealth had become ambivalent as well. He couldn't shake his pride in his planet and his people, but he was too aware of the pointlessness of the endless war and sacrifice. At last, with the full support of his troubled commanders, he left the LCAF and went to the Periphery, looking for a cause he could once again believe in\n\n <b><color=#00ffff>Can Command Tanks and Pilot Mechs.</color></b>",
