    "Details": "Miranda Aguilera grew up in the Lyran Commonwealth. She was a tall kid who made a name for herself as 'the girl you don't mess with.' At eighteen, she signed up with a small-time mercenary company to feed her growing wanderlust. Miranda went undefeated in her crew's drinking games - and in the brawling that usually followed. When her fellow mercenaries turned to piracy, she was in. When they turned over a new leaf, she was out, and looking for a tougher crew.",
