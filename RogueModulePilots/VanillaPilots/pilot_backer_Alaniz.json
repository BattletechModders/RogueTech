    "Details": "Dragon 66 was born Zin Ala in the Federated Suns, the child of a family of military bureaucrats. His stable, safe childhood left him craving more excitement than bureaucracy could provide, so when he was old enough, he enrolled in the planetary guards.\r\n\r\nAfter boot camp, his aptitude tests placed him in logistical support roles â€” not that different from what his family did, but at least he was on the more exciting front lines. Through dedicated service and commitment, Zin worked his way up from driving supply vehicles to planning their routes to overseeing entire logistical operations.\r\n\r\nAll that changed when an operation he was involved with collapsed, leaving him one of the few able-bodied soldiers able to defend a key location. He did a hero's job, but when reinforcements won through, they came with military lawyers and wagging fingers over breaches of protocol.\r\n\r\nAs a result, he ended up on Solaris VII, where he stayed just long enough to establish a reputation. But knowing he had no future there, he moved on to the Periphery, looking for a chance to once again start at the bottom and work his way up.",
