    "Details": "A good father always wants his son to live his own life, not repeat his father's mistakes. But Jeremy Bloodstone couldn't bear to send his infant son away after his wife died. The child grew to adolescence under the watchful eye of his father's mercenary company, permanently stationed on The Edge, in service to the Lyran Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nFinally, when young Jeremiah was 15, and talking about formally joining his father's unit, the elder Bloodstone did what he knew he should have done years ago. He sent his son away, spending his life savings to enroll him in the Blackjack School of Conflict and qualify him for a commission in the LCAF.\r\n\r\nJeremiah excelled at Blackjack, bonding easily with his fellow cadets, many of whom came from similar circumstances. His quick wit, humor and love of practical jokes earned him the nickname 'Jester' amongst friends. Upon graduation Jeremiah earned his commission and was assigned to oversee the training of green units on Hesperus II, site of Defiance Industries.\r\n\r\nEventually, he saw real combat, when the Free Worlds League attacked Hesperus II. HIs unit successfully repelled the invasion and as a reward, he was transferred to a BattleMech unit. He continued serving for another five years, until he received word that his father had been killed in action, still on assignment on The Edge. His father's company, the family that had raised him, had been scattered and killed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as his tour was up, he left the LCAF and headed first to The Edge, and then to the Periphery, tracking down what remained of his father's company. He hopes to one day bring them back together again under a new banner, and meanwhile, he works and networks, just like his father did before he built his own company.",
