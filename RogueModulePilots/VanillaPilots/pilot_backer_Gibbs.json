    "Details": "Whitney was born into a Taurian military family with roots stretching back to the Reunification War. The tradition of serving as a MechWarrior was long a part of Whitney's family, but although traditions lingered, the family had since drifted into poverty and obscurity. Perhaps because of this, Whitney chose a military life out of family loyalty, not her duty as a Concordat citizen.\r\n\r\nShe enrolled in the Taurian Ecole Militaire on Taurus, despite some challenges related to her small size and bookishness, she immediately gravitated toward 'Mech combat. While examinations showed deficiencies in CQC, she displayed an aptitude for long-range and hit-and-run engagements. These earned her the moniker of 'Whisper' for her knack of striking from unexpected directions.\r\n\r\nUpon graduation and being commissioned at 20, she served in a regular line regiment as a Cornet for three years. Despite seeing action in repelling Canopian raiders and pirates her term of service was less eventful than she had hoped - and news from home was growing more concerning. Desiring something more for her family's sake, she left her post with one goal in mind - a career as a mercenary.",
