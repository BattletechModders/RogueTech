    "Details": "Aleksandr Mizahri comes from Tyrlon 5, where he probably had parents and was not actually constructed from spare parts by a sentient trash compactor. He grew up, he says, learning to translate between the strongly worded demands of AgroMechs and the overly-relaxed replies of the mail sorting robots.\r\n\r\nIt was tough keeping the peace between the two factions, but somehow, by age ten, he managed it. As a result, he was accepted as a disciple of a particularly enlightened Dig King. While a disciple, he was taught The Way To Paradise, tested, found worthy, and then sent into the sky.\r\n\r\nAlthough his mission is supposedly to spread knowledge of The Way, he's pretty terrible at evangelizing, preferring to drink, laugh, play card games and in general model 'good behavior.'\r\n\r\nWhile the version he gives of his history is frankly ridiculous, there's not much else to be discovered. Born on the street, raised on the street, and coping however he could, he found something that brings him an inner glow and personal balance. He's very hard to rile up, and nobody can deny that he learned somewhere to be an excellent pilot\n\n <b><color=#00ffff>Can Command Tanks and Pilot Mechs.</color></b>",
