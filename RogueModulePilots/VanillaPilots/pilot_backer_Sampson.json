Not an uncommon act at the time, he still welcomed the opportunity to broaden the MechWarrior skills he'd acquired during school sports.\r\n\r\nWhat could have been a splendid career was severely curtained when he discovered that one of his siblings had been using him as a catspaw in a criminal endeavor with the potential to destabilize a Duchy. Rather than be indicted and betray his foolish brother, he abandoned his position.\r\n\r\nNow he travels the Periphery, taking work as a mercenary. Perhaps he'll make it home again. Perhaps not. Most of his stories of old days are of the Shadow Hawk he piloted on the test range, and if he'll ever see it again\n\n <b><color=#00ffff>Can Command Tanks and Pilot Mechs.</color></b>",
