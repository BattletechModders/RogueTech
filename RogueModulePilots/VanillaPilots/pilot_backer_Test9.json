    "Details": "Test9 grew up on New Syrtis, raised by a scholar who idolized the iconic era of the early Star League. He grew up steeped in the honor and values of legends that may have never happened, learning to model his behavior after knights and his techniques after the Star League gunslingers. When he was grown, he naturally went out questing to discover and nurture what remained of that lost civilization. Although he trained at the Warrior's Hall, and earned some distinction serving in the Armed Forces of the Federated Suns, he realized that the conflicts of the Inner Sphere would never let him really extend himself and work toward building a new golden age. So he went to the Periphery, where he found plenty of opportunities to hone his skills while evaluating the noble potential of the nations there. He's a valued MechWarrior wherever he goes, as his honor and clear-thinking combine to make him a natural leader in crisis situations -- but he rarely stays with any company for more than a year or so before another adventure pulls him away\n\n <b><color=#00ffff>Can Command Tanks and Pilot Mechs.</color></b>",
