    "Details": "Nicolette McKinney was born on Tyrlon 6, the middle child of middle-class parents. She was a quiet, undemanding child in a large and noisy family, and spent most of her time reading books. When she was a teenager, she made more friends, started career training, had a romantic relationshipâ€¦ and somehow, without anybody really noticing, Fell In With A Bad Crowd.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't her, not really. It was her lover, who, while a wonderful person, just couldn't seem to avoid getting in over their head with some <i>really</i> questionable people. And, over and over again, it was up to Nicolette to get them out of trouble. Eventually, those questionable people started paying Nicollette for her work, and she was lying every holiday to her family about what she did for a living, and she told herself every job was the last one. But every time she thought she'd escaped, her old friend would come back to her again.\r\n\r\nOne day, after providing recon support on a sabotage mission, she realized just how far her employers had stretched. The ruling house of the Aurigan Coalition fell, and she, Nicollete McKinney was, just a tiny bit, culpable.\r\n\r\nThat was the push she needed. She said farewell to her family, wrote a painfully long letter to her old lover, and talked her way onto the first mercenary ship she found leaving the system. She's been fighting ever since, and hoping like hell that nobody from her past life ever tracks her down.",
