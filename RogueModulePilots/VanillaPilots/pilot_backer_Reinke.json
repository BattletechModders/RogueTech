    "Details": "Kyone Akashi was the eldest child and first daughter of a DCMS MechWarrior. Her father decided early to train her to inherit his skills, as she was by far the most aggressive of his children. She spent her childhood being taught by retainers, while being instructed remotely by her father. On his rare return visits, he would test her. When she was fourteen, she won early admission to the Benjamin District Gymnasium.\r\n\r\nShortly before she could graduate from the Gymnasium, her father was arrested as a traitor and the family assets were seized by ISF. She learned this when a friend of her father's attempted to kidnap her from the school for her own protection. After verifying her prisoner's story, she decided to accompany him off-planet to that she might investigate and if needed, avenge her family.\r\n\r\nHer guardian had other plans. Soothing her with talk of a long game, Kyone and 'Uncle' Yosuke spent several years traveling from one system to the next, with less and less talk of returning to Shirotori. Eventually, having traveled enough to realize the futility of it, Kyone gave up talk of justice and revenge.\r\n\r\nSoon after, Yosuke's money ran out. Coincidentally, they happened to be on Solaris VII at that point. Bored with constant travel, Kyone chose not to dig below the surface of her guardian's request that she participate in gladiator fights to help with the bills.\r\n\r\nShe won early and often, and the financial pressures on her protector eased. But as her battles became more and more carefully arranged, and more and more risky, Yosuke's financial burdens grew again. And yet Kyone enjoyed herself… until one bloodsoaked black night all her pleasure in the arena vanished forever. That was the night she discovered Yosuke, brutally murdered over secret debts he'd incurred supporting her all those years, and set out to punish those who had once again taken her family.\r\n\r\nThat was then. Now... she's in the Periphery, alone, working as a mercenary MechWarrior. She doesn't talk much. And when she fights, she's very, very hard to stop.",
