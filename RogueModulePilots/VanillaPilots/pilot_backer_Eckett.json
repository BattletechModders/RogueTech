    "Details": "Sandy Bodenstedt was born in the Lyran Commonwealth in the system of Weingarten. She was the youngest child of affectionate parents who encouraged her and, as a result, she won an academic sponsorship from Bountiful Delicacies.\r\n\r\nAt college, she was trained as an archivist, and once she graduated, she was sent by her sponsor to work in the vineyards of Weingarten III. But her love of learning soon became a wanderlust and she negotiated a new position as a brand ambassador for Bountiful Delicacies.\r\n\r\nFor a time, she traveled the Lyran Commonwealth and the greater Inner Sphere, encouraging people to thrill bored palates with exotic foodstuffs. But after a failed relationship and growing dissatisfaction with her employer, she decided one day to simply walk away.\r\n\r\nWithout much eye to the future, she spent her savings exploring the Federated Suns and eventually found herself in a relationship with a mercenary captain. She joined him when he took his company out to the Periphery. Out there, she finally understood her need to fight battles that mattered to somebody, and how the only way to be sure of that was to charge a very great deal of money.\r\n\r\nIt took some time for her lover's company to accept her as a fellow pilot, but after her lover was killed on a catastrophic contracts, it was Sandy who got the rest of them out, and guided them to new homes. Now, she once again travels alone, but her MechWarrior skills make it so that she'll always be able to fulfill her twin goals of travel, and fighting battles that matter to somebody.",
