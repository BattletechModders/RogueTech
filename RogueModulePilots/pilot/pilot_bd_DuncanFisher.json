        "Details": "Once an up-and-coming medium mech pilot in the arenas of Solaris VII, Duncan Fisher quickly found he had a face for radio, not for tri-vid. After a decent, but short, stint in the arenas, Duncan fell into the life of a professional S7 caster, where he found much acclaim. He cast multiple Championship bouts in his time behind the mic and was widely beloved by the fans for his bombastic personality. Now, he's found his way into a cockpit again for a little up close and personal match analysis. Better keep the bar well stocked with whiskey and cigars.",
