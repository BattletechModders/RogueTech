    "Details": "Savarok grew up in comfort, with a family that worked hard to pay their way with their Agromech repair and maintenance company.   This comfort bred complacency, contempt and a rebellious attitude, despite having a natural aptitude for piloting he slacked off, bad mouthed his parents to anyone who would listen and ruined potential career opportunities for himself.  This culminated when an ill tempered rant about a prestigious land owner whom was going to give his family enough business for generations was overheard.   The contract was only to be kept if Savarok was removed from the family 'and' the planet.   Within hours he found himself with a rucksack of clothes and a pocket of c-bills aboard a transport to the periphery.  Savarok realised on this trip that an Agromech pilot was going to struggle for work so he lied, begged, and borrowed (sometimes permanently) for any work at every opportunity at every port but this always ended in trouble until he was picked up by a pirate mercenary company as a repair tech.   An opportunity for Savarok arose to pilot the ramshackle pieces of metal the pirates called battlemechs and he grew in confidence quickly - too quickly.  The rebellious nature reared it's ugly head again and after a severe disagreement with the pirate leader he found himself stripped of pirate uniform and heraldry on the wrong side of an airlock door about to be spaced.  Just as the leader was going to press the release button on the outer doors a local government militia ship had snuck up and boarded the pirate ship,  The pirates were all killed and the militia stumbled on him in the airlock.   With some quick thinking he was able to convince the miltia he was not affiliated with the pirates and he was spared.   This was the defining moment for him as he now realised he had a second opportunity to live and vowed to not let any of the bad habits of his past continue.   Savarok now travels between mercenary companies as a mechwarrior looking for good honest work to live.",
