        "Details": "Some men have easy, soft lives, full of comfort and joy. Hardball is not one of those men. Born to nobody parents on a backwater Crucis March world in the Federated Suns, Elias was destined for nothing his whole life. His parents, subsistence farmers, had five children of which Elias was the last. He was expected to work the farm, marry, have kids, and start his own farm, like his older brothers and sisters. But he wanted more. He dreamed of travelling the stars, seeing other worlds, and fighting for his fellows and their freedoms in the Federated Suns. When a recruiter for the AFFS came to his little town one year, he knew his chance had arrived and signed up without hesitation. However, he was too young and was turned away. Of course, stowing away in their truck fixed that... until he was discovered. His earnestness appealed to the recruiter, who took an interest in the young man and decided to give him a shot, rules be damned. \r\n\r\nElias earned his callsign during training where he developed a bad habit of never playing fair or nice with the other recruits. Elias played to win and everything else was irrelevant. Despite this, his obvious skill in a cockpit got him assigned to a front-line command as a scout mech pilot where he saw engagement against the Draconis Combine. After several incidents where he injured other soldiers who got in his way on the battlefield, he was discharged from service and even imprisoned for a time. \r\n\r\nHis record gets spotty after that, with various reports of prison time, murder charges, and an ugly divorce, all of which has left the once bright-eyed Elias a battered, rough man. Still, he can sling shots downrange and take orders like few others, ensuring he always gets a space on a dropship. For awhile, at least, until his rough ways catch up to him again.",
