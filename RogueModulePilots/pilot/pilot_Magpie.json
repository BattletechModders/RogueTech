Nicknamed Magpie for her love of shiny things, Natasha somehow manages to live a life of luxury even while on the run. Apparently her old network fell apart when she ''misplaced'' a few packages. She’s running from her creditors ever since. Apparently if we bring her aboard, she’ll hook us up with a supply cache somewhere in system. Even better, she claims to be a qualified mechanic and is licensed to drive a variety of ground crawlers. Maybe, we could put her to use as a tank pilot? XO’s note: Boss, I hope you know what you are doing letting Magpie on the ship. Anyone gets wind of her being on the ship before we are gone and we could have trouble on our hands.",
