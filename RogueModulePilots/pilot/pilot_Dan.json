    "Details": "Dan got his start, like most enigmatic anti-heroes, on some forgotten deep periphery world, where the only education was the School of Hard Knocks.  Realizing life on Planet Noir was not going to end well, regardless of what some woman in red claimed, Dan found passage off the planet with some space whalers who hailed from the Jarnfolk region.  What he didn't know then was, they weren't just sea-shanty singing lunatics hunting hallucinations of space whales, but a top secret black-ops group hunting Killer Whale missile systems from the old SLDF. After a few years, and significant training to correct Dan's issue of calling every moving piece of metal an Atlas, the group found a cache of SLDF mechs instead of the promised Killer Whales.  Dan, inquisitive as ever, jumped into one and turned it on, triggering the cache's self-destruct and killing his compatriots, while he walked out unscathed in a pristine SLDF mech.  His last words to the group were \"this will be a whale of a good time!\". \n\n <b><color=#00ffff>Can Command Tanks and Pilot Mechs.</color></b>",
