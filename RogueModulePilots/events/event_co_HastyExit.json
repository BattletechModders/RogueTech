Good to know I got through to you, I was beginning to think I’d die of old age before your XO would put me through. You don’t remember me but, some idiot misplaced a few crates of my AC/5 ammo on your shuttle sometime back. You did me a favour then and I’d like you to do another for me now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really?\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I’m in a spot of bother with the local crime syndicate over some misplaced demolition charges. Nothing too serious, but they want blood. You hire me and get me out of this system and I’ll give you the coordinates of a supply cache I know about.\" Suddenly the Holovid blinks out.\r\n\r\n\"Commander, I’d recommend not associating with such a shady character, it won't end well for us.\" Darius says.",
