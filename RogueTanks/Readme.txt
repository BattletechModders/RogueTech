Roguetanks
By Cargo Vroom

The vehicles of Roguetech. Originally based on Vehicle Improvement Project, now grown out of all proportion.

Some units by LadyAlecto and Justin Kase

RogueTanks Modules:

RogueTanks - The Majority of RT's vehicles, things available widely in the IS and Periphery.
PrimitiveTanks - Units mostly armed with Rifles, RL, MG, and basic 3025 weapons, only the most ragtag of insterstelar powers use these, they're often found in the hands of local militia and cash strapped mercs.
CLANK - Clan tanks with clan gear.
PLANK - Units mostly armed with the odd pirate weapons cobbled together by people who probably shout "Witness Me!"

2.2.3

Gave Scimitar (LRM) the SRM2 launchers it was missing.

Slight buff to Assault class Carriers like Ontos that could never hit anything.

2.2.1

Added SRM Carrier (ECM)
Removed "unit_tracked" and "unit_wheels" tags from all hover units.
Changed motive type on all hovertanks to "Wheeled" their movement penalties are more similar in CBT.

Made a "unit_noconvoy" tag; applied it to the swiftwind; added it to exclusion list of OpForConvoy lances.

2.1.7
 
Gave slightly better loot to a bunch of vehicles even if it was just a non-stock MG.
Gave serious gear to a couple, like the now very accurate Pike and the 'elite' Manticore_dupe
    I think it improves player experience, their reaction to seeing a plus weapon on a tank, 
    even if it's actually just a +Crit Mlaser, is a mix of worry and greed that overcomes any disapointment 
    that the vehicle isn't a pinata they can beat for mech parts.


Installed MG arrays in several vehicles that had 4 or more MG's.
Fixed two Brutus tanks sharing a def,
Fixed Pegasus_RT move speed,
Fixed some bugs in the APC's I changed last time.

Added 80 ton TBM15 carrier,
Added 80 ton TBM10 carrier,
Added 60 ton TBM5 carrier,
Added 60 ton TBM5 and LRM15 hybrid carrier,
Added 60 ton TBM10 and LRM5 hybrid carrier

Added a tracked vehicle movment tweak i forgot to import from VIP into Core.

2.0.0

Complete restructruing. VIP merged with RogueTank. This is now RoguetankXL, the majority of units, and almost all the ones that don't have an individual ingame chassis go here. Roguetank Core contains APCS, variations on vanilla vehicles, and a few carefully selected others.

Corrected armor of Alcorn.
Corrected armor on Demolisher II.
Found Demolisher-R, Shepard, Rottweiler, Kingscorpion to be underweight by TT rules. Corrected trying not to change the spirit of the designs.
Gorgon wasn't TT legal without some involved changes. Found that XL engine allowed something very close to original, it's a medium now.
Harrasser-B overweight. Loadout nerfed to two SSRM4.
Rebuilt Merkava IV and rechristened it "Chariot" because of lore naming conflict and it being to heavy to run with an ICE.

Added two variants of the Fulcrum, an endgame (High BV) hovertank.
Added two variants of Regulator, a medium sniper hovertank.
Added Zephyr (ECM)
