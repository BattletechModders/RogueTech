Roguetanks
By Cargo Vroom

The vehicles of Roguetech. Originally based on Vehicle Improvement Project, now grown out of all proportion.

Some units by LadyAlecto and Justin Kase

RogueTanks Modules:

RogueTanks - The Majority of RT's vehicles, things available widely in the IS and Periphery.
PrimitiveTanks - Units mostly armed with Rifles, RL, MG, and basic 3025 weapons, only the most ragtag of interstellar powers use these, they're often found in the hands of local militia and cash strapped mercs.
CLANK - Clan tanks with clan gear.
PLANK - Units mostly armed with the odd pirate weapons cobbled together by people who probably shout "Witness Me!"

Custom Tags List:

unit_hover,
unit_noconvoy, Things that are too fast, or too slow, to be appropriate and fun in convoys
unit_primitive,
unit_carrier,
unit_stealth,
unit_predator, Things with boosted sensor or tagging gear
unit_vbied, Things with suicide bombs

unit_galleon,
unit_behemoth,
unit_harasser,
unit_ontos,
unit_scimitar,
unit_brutus,

2.1.7
 
Gave slightly better loot to a bunch of vehicles even if it was just a non-stock MG.
Gave serious gear to a couple, like the now very accurate Pike and the 'elite' Manticore_dupe
    I think it improves player experience, their reaction to seeing a plus weapon on a tank, 
    even if it's actually just a +Crit Mlaser, is a mix of worry and greed that overcomes any disapointment 
    that the vehicle isn't a pinata they can beat for mech parts.

Fixed Pegasus_RT move speed,

Corrected armor of Alcorn.
Corrected armor on Demolisher II.
Found Demolisher-R, Shepard, Rottweiler, Kingscorpion to be underweight by TT rules. Corrected trying not to change the spirit of the designs.
Gorgon wasn't TT legal without some involved changes. Found that XL engine allowed something very close to original, it's a medium now.
Harrasser-B overweight. Loadout nerfed to two SSRM4.
Rebuilt Merkava IV and rechristened it "Chariot" because of lore naming conflict and it being to heavy to run with an ICE.
