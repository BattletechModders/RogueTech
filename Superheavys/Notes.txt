Notes about DestroyBase_itsatrap_BRUTAL
    It will now try to find a difficulty +15 turret lance.
    The only such one that currently exists is the Arty Turret lance in the Arty folder.
    If the contract can't find that one because the module is not present it should pick normal turrets.

0.3.6 - 4/9/2019

Added Parti-Kill tank (blacklisted for now),
Set basic versions of superheavy contracts to appear first, and only once.
