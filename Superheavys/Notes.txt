0.5.3 - 5/16/2019

Updated Gulltoppr with clan AMS,
Updated Metal Storm to use newer RISC weapons,
Updated Object-404 with Feint TBMs and RE-lasers,

0.4.1 - 4/9/2019

Added SCREWYOURAMS (Singijeon) Clan superheavy lrm carrier,
Released Parti-Kill into the wild to see how it does,
Minor tweaks

0.3.9 - 4/9/2019

Added Assassinate_Superheavy_Scientists - A contract with an easy target but challenging defenders
Fixed some Requirements stuff in other superheavy contracts

Notes about DestroyBase_itsatrap_BRUTAL
    It will now try to find a difficulty +15 turret lance.
    The only such one that currently exists is the Arty Turret lance in the Arty folder.
    If the contract can't find that one because the module is not present it should pick normal turrets.

0.3.6 - 4/9/2019

Added Parti-Kill tank (blacklisted for now),
Set basic versions of superheavy contracts to appear first, and only once.
    Harder versions allowed to spawn afterward for people's second try.

Added Obliterator, a supersized Clan Demolisher with dual Railguns

0.3.3 - 3/15/2019

Removed hardcoded pilot settings from superheavy contracts giving it back to the lances. This allows some of the extra-high skill elite pilots to spawn if the lance calls for them. As well as matching tanker crews with vehicles.
