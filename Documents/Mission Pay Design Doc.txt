Mission Pay Design Doc - By Cargo_Vroom

Objective pay modifiers should be slanted toward the mission's primary goal.
e.g. Rescue doesn't encourage getting kills. But Battles should value each unit destroyed.

Additional Lances will intrude often, and should be given the lowest per-lance reward tier.

5% and 5000cb
