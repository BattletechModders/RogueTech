The  "Action" you want (with scope Company) is 

{
                    "Type" : "MechWarrior_AddRoster",
                    "value" : "pilot_backer_Leone",
                    "valueConstant" : null,
                    "additionalValues" : null
                },


These are also useful for other stuff if you need them to fire a mechwarrior, add a mech to the hangar:

{
                    "Type" : "MechWarrior_Fire",
                    "value" : "pilot_sim_starter_behemoth",
                    "valueConstant" : null,
                    "additionalValues" : null
                },
{
                    "Type" : "Mech_AddRoster",
                    "value" : "mechdef_centurion_CN9-AS",                
                    "valueConstant" : null,
                    "additionalValues" : null
                }

Adding an item to inventory is for some reason under "Stats" and not "Actions" - the "2" below is quantity. Removing an item from inventory is just applying a negative quantity. I've not yet figured out how to remove a 'Mech from inventory.
{
                    "typeString" : "System.Int32",
                    "name" : "Item.WeaponDef.Weapon_Laser_MediumLaser_0-STOCK",
                    "value" : 2,
                    "valueConstant" : ""
                },
