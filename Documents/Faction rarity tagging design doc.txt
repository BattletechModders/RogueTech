Faction rarity retagging

extensive update to "{CUR_TEAM.faction}"

eg:

for Kurita

 "rare_{CUR_TEAM.faction}"

will create

rare_kurita

tag for the lance spawner to search for

Goal:
Have every chassis avaible everywhere but have their rarity restricted in lances by faction


Raritys:

Ultrarare_

Chassis that are experimental or stolen tech, if not just outright looted clantech and elites

An example would be a clan mech in the hands of the fis, same as royals

For clanners this would be inner sphere prototypes or units and designs not typical for clan

Rare_

Chassis that probably got looted and refit by this faction, an example would be a davion mauler in a kurita lance

also would be a factions prototypes they have build 

An example would be a stealth raven for liao, that in turn would be ultra rare for their neighbours

Uncommon_

Chassis that neighbouring factions have and field but not actively produced

An example would be the Bushwhacker for steiner, which would be rare for other factions

Common_

Chassis that are actively build and produced by this faction, these may also be primitives

Thinks the shadowhawk k for kurita, since thats their massproduced refit
