Type:
These are the main categories used by various systems to find units of the three general categories.

"unit_vehicle",
"unit_mech",
"unit_turret"

Spawn Category:
Base unit archetype. These are how lances pick things to spawn. *Please do not give units more than two of these four tags*

"unit_lance_vanguard" - designed to attack and flank the enemys, the spearhead of a lance
"unit_lance_assassin" - designed to bring killshots
"unit_lance_support" - designed to support the lance
"unit_lance_tank" - soak up the damage

AI Roles:
These change the unit behavior. Setting doesn't work on vehicles, they always revert to "unit_role_vehicle"

"unit_role_meleeonly" - Unit to engage in melee only
"unit_role_sniper" - Unit will use long range weapons as much as possible
"unit_role_brawler" - Unit will engage in brawls
"unit_role_scout" - Unit will scout the map for enemy contacts, and will try to keep moving
"unit_role_flanker" - Unit will attempt to flank enemies, WARNING DEAD HBS CODE, this role doesn't do anything

Other: 

"unit_melee" - Unit can engage in melee.
"unit_jumpOK" - Unit can use Jump Jets to move around the map

Strength:
Approximate strength of a unit - we need to decide on a good average middle

"unit_bracket_low", - low tier units like locusts and primitives mediums
"unit_bracket_med", - average units not the best of all classes but no pushovers either, basically vanilla meds and heavies
"unit_bracket_high", - the nasties that bring pain

Tech Level:

What kind of tech and firepower the unit can bring to bear

Clan OmniMechs should get "unit_advanced" to reduce rarity of them

Also did add a few legendary clan spawned mechs to plug holes in elite lances (mostly prototypes and society variants) -*ladyalekto
