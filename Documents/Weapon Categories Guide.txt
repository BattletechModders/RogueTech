Each weapon require correct categories to appear in mechbay. Some of them can have more then one and appear in more then one tab or can have additional categories for some restrictions. To add category add "Category" section under "Custom" section of JSON like this:

    "Custom": {
        "Category": [
			{ "CategoryID": "w/m/t/arrowiv" }
		],
        ... other customs
    },
	
full list of categories can be found in CustomComponents\categories\Categories_Weapons.json

examlpe of multi category item:

it have 4 categories, color taken from first, other used only for filters and description tags
        
		"Category": [
			{ "CategoryID": "w/m/s/mml" },
			{ "CategoryID": "w/m/s/srm" },
			{ "CategoryID": "w/m/l/lrm" },
			{ "CategoryID": "w/m/l/mrm" }
		],

Melee Weapon:
"MeleeWeapon" there restricts weapons to 1 per location and "w/s/m/melee" put item under melee weapon tab in mechlab

        "Category": [
			{ "CategoryID": "MeleeWeapon" },
			{ "CategoryID": "w/s/m/melee" }
		],

		"Category": [
            { "CategoryID": "AMS" },

        ],
