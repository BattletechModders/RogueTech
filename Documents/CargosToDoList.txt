TAC chances may be much lower that some of us thought with non-obvious base chance of 0.1 instead of 0.5 https://roguetech.fandom.com/wiki/Critical_Hit
This makes the crit chance of even weapons like TANDEM that double the APC crit chance incredibly unlikely to ever TAC.
Additionally TAC is solidly walled by APMaxArmorThickness, even if TAD occurs, a fact unbeknownst to Cargo until recently.

Escort missions suck, because their main structure drip-feeds single lances to a larger player force.
Also the convoys are getting pretty chonky these days.
Also Additional Lances, while they provide challenge for the expanded player force further drag out a long mission type by basically prefacing it with a Simple Battle.

Alt versions of VTOL? Ones with bombs get higher Difficulty rating? 

Make vehicle amphibious/sealed and SH into structure types instead of traits or upgrades.

Try to get Turret's "Marked Range" trait player visible in mission if it isn't.

Can make alt version of Rescue SAR where the primary and secondary objectives are swapped in position?

AI possibly needs to have spacing increased if possible.
AI affection for forests too great, especially considering they are a mixed blessing!

Maybe look at vehicles getting hecking long move somehow. Carriers moving for 8 evasion in open?
Possibly re-evaluate move bonus from piloting, transfer concept to an affinity on motive type equipment.

Can we make the Mobile Long Tom into a "Squad" with the trailers as units in the train?

In this video video from an old build at the timecode I'm linking a tank gets 40% Damage Reduction from Bulwark in Cover.

So i wasn't misremembering when I did initial testing of my MBT quirk and thought I saw vehicles getting bulwark! What is going on here? I was told more recently it wasn't working and can't work!

Check up on TAG discussion

What is this???
  "CustomParts": {
    "CustomParts": [],
    "CrewLocation": "None" <-----
  },

How much damage does Incendiary LRM do to vehicle armor? multiplier and heat conversion might not be interacting the way i intended.

Why are all pilot quirks positive? Whoever did that basically broke all the pilot events that remove bad tags.

Should Weapon_LRM_FLARELAUNCHER_AMS be an advanced ams? I've never been sure why it was. Being normal would make it both less and more useful. The individual choppers that are the things that use it most wouldn't blow their small stack of flares on things not targeted at them.

Rotary Rifle recoil is a bit odd. In 1-2 shot modes they have no recoil. Not even the same recoil as the base weapon. I think this might have been an error when I rebalanced them quite a while ago. Should we give them base recoil?

Should we detune RAC special ammo a bit? Less special effects, more basic damage?

I've seen multiple reports of Engineer Team vehicles in Defend Base not driving to the base. And an anecdote about needing to have a unit in the destination to get them to move. It seems like we have issues when AI can't see things. (Loooooo Vizzzzz!?!)

Flamers are seldom the choice for overheat builds. Are they in a good place? Anything we should tweak?

Our effective range of pilot skill levels seem very compressed. Ronin start with enough exp to hit at least 3,3,3,3, or more with favorable progression settings. With the plethora of skill bonuses from quirks, affinities, gear and traits amplifying everything. We have 1-10. But we're only using about 3-8 before adjusted skills hit 10 or better.

What's up with weapons with a base shotswhenfired of 0? re the fix to Internal Bomb Bay vs Thunderstorm, all AMS, and LAM Hardpoints. (Tangential, why did Hark switch the Bomb Bay from missile to AC20 type?)

Why is Reflective/Glazed armor so bad? Compared to Reactive, which makes you take less damage from 2/3 of weapon types and gives you TAD/TAC Immune.

Check on Assassination target lance settings. What friends can it bring. Do we still need them with Support Lances?


----------------------------------------------------------
Escapist Ability is crap because using that +2 max Ev. requires moving 11+ hexes. Most units can't do that ever.

(Obsolete observation after Evasion rework in HHR.)

Prices for engine types are kinda messed up. No proper zero cost default for Fuel Cell etc. Can't put flat modifier on it or ICE because some vehicle costs would go negative and it wouldn't bring down the price of larger engines that significantly. Basic problem is that it's centered on Fusion, instead of starting with ICE as zero and going up.

(Handled with change to TT cost calculation engines as part of vehicle total price.)

Are hand held mech grenades too weak? They are tiny aoe, and low damage significantly smaller than most other explosives, especially HE Bombs for LAM/VTOL of the same weight.

(Handled with minor buff to core mech grenades, QS ones untouched)

Should Streak LRM get a range bonus over normal like Streak SRM do? That's +1 hex base range. (But also +33% base range in context)

(One affirmative, no objections voiced, doing it.)

Should Quirks folder weapons and gear all be blacklisted? Some are some are not. If yes, what about wiki whitelisted?

(Blacklisted all and wikiwhitelisted most)

Does anyone mind if I swap some Generic AC/2 to variants on mechs? Some are un-used!

(Done)

If AOE can't crit at all anymore, we should take the crit malus off Swarm ammo.

(No objections after floating idea, Done.)

Can AA Factor statuseffect be put on ammo? If so, should it be up on SAM and FLAK ammo?

(Isn't practical, would need to be on the box.)

Is VTOL Jet Booster in a good place? It's worse than the canonical TT one in multiple ways. It shouldn't ever fail. But it affects maneuvering in ways we don't have mechanics for.

(I buffed it a bit)

Weapons with bonuses vs BA need another look, we can less +ACC and add some +Dmg?
Should anti-ba also apply to protomechs? Or have a few anti-proto weapons?

(Done)

Potential +Innitive and/or +Tactics stacking issue with Tacticon Quirk, Tank Communications Equipment, Drone Controller.

(I believe handled in Hark's rework)

Do we have a power creep war between +Evasion and +Evasion Ignore? Both used to be rare. And it doesn't matter who wins, evasion loses because unboosted evasion matters less.

(De-creep in progress)

^^^^^^^^^^ Answered and Finished ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Should Quirks have cbill value? a few do, most don't. Not sure if intentional.

(Intentional, review indicated)

We don't have consistent weapon size naming style. Many, perhaps most are like this: "ATM/9" But "ATM9" and "ATM 9" also exist. I would like to standardize on ATM/9.

(Turns out to be a lore issue, it's heavily inconsistent. Far back burner)

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Answered No Action ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Should we put Ammo Resupply on some vehicles with large cargo compartments?

Do tanks in general and heavy MBT designed for big ballistics in particular get more recoil mitigation? Heck they're harder to destabilize than a running boi.

(Tank recoil resist improved, check again later.)

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Answer unclear, ask again later ^^^^^^^

Cargo's Note List

~9 HBSBT damage per kilogram of TNT equivalent 

Arty shell aprox damage calc theory:

1000/[shots per ton]/2/3*9, half propellent half charge, 30% of force heads toward nearby object, 9 upconversion as above.

1000/shots*1.5=AOE damage

works for Thumper. Either sniper/longtom ammo per ton or damage is wrong.

Transport helicopters are operated in assault, medium and heavy classes. 
Air assault helicopters are usually the smallest of the transport types, and designed to move an infantry squad or section and their equipment. 
Helicopters in the assault role are generally armed for self-protection both in transit and for suppression of the landing zone

Report of 3waybattle autocompleteing with enemy still on the field, probably Additional Lances units 11/30/2020

Prototype Heatsinks add 1% critical hit taken chance malus per?
    Any other Prototype gear for that matter.

Copypasta in vehicle fluff

Trim Vehicle names.

Tune what spawns in B-Team type missions.

Spall Liner to upgrade or specialist slot item; take 1 slot in each location like stealth?

Allies not returning to follow mode!!!
    Should allies be in Blackout considering their fairly frequent issues with travel?

More Arty shells
    Missing utility: flare and smoke
    Cluster bombs with submunitions
    FAE shells

VTOL Cluster Bombs should use HasShells

Remake Scorpion's Nest with MC lance size function.

Make more Warthog VTOLs. LBX20? SBG?

Make Flare mortar rounds apply a design mask like smoke. Everything in it is more visible

Replace Exponent evasion pips algebra problem traits with statements of effect. eg. 
    "{0} Recoil Per Evasion Pip" vs "Recoil Change based on your evasion. Base Recoil multiplied by: Number of Evasion Pips to the power of {0}",
    This is mostly straightforward, Heavy Gauss is 1 recoil per pip for example. Some weirdness with select fire weapons like RAC.
    
Make sure an Explodium trait is on every damage on jam weapon

Orion X has wrong description

Do APCs need unit_lance tags?

Does Tanker defender trait do anything? what's up with guarded/entrenched and vehicles?

Work on VTOL List

Figure out and do things with Target Acquisition

Vultures are too small? Stormcrows possibly too big.

Check TAG and NARC stacking, what should stack what shouldn't and how will the player know.

Reworded objectives could make a Destroy Base or Rescue where *not* destroying the enemy units was a goal. Strongly negative cash for killing the lance. Forcing players to do the primary and extract

Shakedown by port authority event

Amputation and cyber limb events

We have a prefab for the Union dropship. it could be used in contracts as a building/turret.
