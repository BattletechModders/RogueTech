I'm thinking that some kind of celebration is in order\u2026 anyone have any ideas?\"\r\n\r\nSumire raises her hand. \"My family used to observe the Festival of Lights around this time of year. We'd light candles for the dead, then throw a wild party in their honor.\"\r\n\r\nYang snorts. \"C'mon, Sumire. That sounds a little highbrow for people who go skinny dipping in coolant tanks. How 'bout we give {TGT_MW.Callsign} permission to throw a keg party instead?\"",
