It was an unruly crew, but an effective one - roaming the Periphery afforded your outfit with a steady supply of poorly defended merchant caravans and supply depots to prey upon. While raids did occasionally devolve into combat, you quickly learned that successful piracy is mostly about being in the right place, at the right time, with the right threats and a good show of force.\r\n\r\n+1 [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[StatMechWarriorGuts],Guts]]",
    "Intro" : "After years of roaming the Frontier, your outfit's luck eventually ran out, landing you in an [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreAuriganCoalition],Aurigan Coalition]] prison. Hearing of your bad turn of fortune, Raju dragged you out of jail, giving you a second chance under his mentorship. After heavy rehabilitation, you proved your worth and were inducted into the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreHouseArano],House Arano]] Royal Guard.\r\n\r\nSo it is that you find yourself reunited with your old mentor, preparing your ancestral [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreAncestralBlackjack],Blackjack]] for guard duty on the coronation day of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKameaArano],Lady Kamea Arano]]\u2026",
	"BioDescription" : "Excerpt of a Letter to Lyran Highcommand: 'I have received your communication of last month in which you state your intention to hunt down, pen up, eradicate, and ultimately destroy myself and my band of fellow privateers. As an aside, sir, I respectfully point out that I prefer to be called a ''Corsair''. Yes, I rather fancy that. The term ''pirate'' is such a widely misused and hackneyed term these days'.\r\n"
