Vehicle Core Design Doc

ICE and Fuel Cell vehicles previously did not have fusion cores.
But we need them now because of new damage and engine explosion mechanics.

They need these thingys added to inventory:

            {
                  "MountedLocation": "Rear",
                  "ComponentDefID": "emod_engine_XXX",
                  "ComponentDefType": "HeatSink",
                  "HardpointSlot": -1,
                  "DamageLevel": "Functional"
            },

Change the XXX to whatever engine size the particular vehicle needs. It's always three digits, so _070 not _70

You can find the engine sizes for each vehicle chassis on Sarna, or check the list below.
Please add them as neatly as possible, right after the ICE, before the internal mechanisms, like this:


            {
                  "MountedLocation": "Rear",
                  "ComponentDefID": "emod_engineslots_ICE_center",
                  "ComponentDefType": "HeatSink",
                  "HardpointSlot": -1,
                  "DamageLevel": "Functional"
            },            
            {
                  "MountedLocation": "Rear",
                  "ComponentDefID": "emod_engine_XXX",
                  "ComponentDefType": "HeatSink",
                  "HardpointSlot": -1,
                  "DamageLevel": "Functional"
            },
            {
                  "ComponentDefID": "Tank_Turret",
                  "ComponentDefType": "Upgrade",
                  "MountedLocation": "Turret",
                  "HardpointSlot": -1,
                  "DamageLevel": "Functional"
            },
